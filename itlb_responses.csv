Wayfair started life in 2002 as a collection of independent websites selling category-specific home furniture, but became a one-stop-shop for the home category in 2011 when at 500 million in sales the team consolidated their 240 websites into wayfair.com. Today, the business offers 22 million products from 16,000 suppliers to more than 30 million customers. During our conversation, we discuss how the competitive frontiers in e-commerce have changed, what it was like to build out a proprietary logistics operation, and what makes the home goods market more attractive than other physical goods markets. Please enjoy this great conversation with Niraj Shah.","Patrick, I've listened to your podcast. And so I would say that I'm aware of you asking that question and I was thinking about my answer before this. And unfortunately, I have to say my is going to prove to not be a novel one because, as I've heard many folks credit the kind of support and encouragement that their parents gave them and I've heard many folks do the same with regards to their spouse, those are the same folks I would go to. And my parents were super supportive when I told them I did not want to attend graduate school and I wanted to be an entrepreneur, which my parents were first generation immigrants from India and education was the de-risk path to success. Graduate school was a step on that journey and I chose not to do that. And obviously hindsight, whatever. It worked out just fine, but they were very supportive. They never even blinked an eye and that was the whole experience through my youth. And then my wife is an amazing person, we've been married 18 years. And I have to say similarly, entirely supportive, including sometimes a personal sacrifice of her. So I have to say that I don't have a novel answer for you, but that's my answer, and I'm happy with it.",Parents,,Wife,Support,Acts of Service,

Will founded Planet in 2010 with a small team of NASA scientists to build a constellation of satellites that would image the entire earth every day. Since then, Planet has successfully built and deployed 450 satellites into space, which the company is using to create a time series of images for every place on earth. Our conversation covers the untold space story. How space is going through an internet moment where cost reductions and performance enhancements have led to a seismic shift in what's possible above our atmosphere and how that can drastically improve life on earth through unique data sets like the one Planet's piecing together. Once you listen to Will speak about Planet's progress and mission, it's hard to think of a more underappreciated company in business today. Please enjoy this great conversation with Will Marshall.","I should think about that more, but the first thing that comes to my mind is mentorship. I've had some incredible mentors that helped to guide me to where I am today. My PhD supervisor last year won the Nobel Prize in physics. He was an amazing guide.

Sarah's CV sparkles with impressive achievements and interesting businesses. And we spent a lot of time in this conversation thinking through what excellence looks like as a CEO, CFO, equity analyst and board member. The rest of our discussion is focused on Nextdoor and how the soon to be public business is fostering connections between people and businesses in their local areas. I do this podcast so I get to meet and learn from people like Sarah. I could have talked to her for hours. I hope you enjoy this great conversation with Sarah Friar as much as I did.","I love that you've asked this question. I feel like I now need to have a great answer, I don’t want to blow your horn. I was thinking back on this, because I know that you ask this question. And so, it took me all the way back to growing up in Northern Ireland. And when the first bomb went off in our local village, I grew up in this really small little village of about 1200 people. The local police barracks got blown up and it took out all the windows in the back of our house. We didn't live a particularly big house, all the windows in the back, my bedroom, the dining room, the kitchen, all the windows blew in. So, there's glass everywhere. And it had been a pretty traumatizing day because I had been in primary school. So, I was probably about 10 and we'd all had to shelter on our desks.The bomb finally went off the glass. There came in around us. It almost makes me cheerful thinking back on it. But what was amazing in terms of an act of kind is the minute we walked in the front door and my mom picked us up from work, our neighbors came in, took a look and they went back out and they had figured out where they could go by plywood. And my dad wasn't super handy so we were very grateful for this. They came in and they boarded up all our windows. And I remember Marcella, the mom bringing us hot food cause our kitchen was a disaster. But what made that really poignant is the whole divide in Northern Ireland was religious. And we were Protestant and our door neighbors are Catholic. And so, technically we were meant to hate each other. That's why people were blowing up things. And yet the fact that kindness that they just came that night, I just have such a sense of warmth still because it was a brutal like a day you never forget in your life. That family still lives next door to my mom and dad. They still show amazing kindness to us, but that night really sticks with me.",Neighbor,,,Help in time of need,Acts of Service,

But there are so many examples in Silicon Valley where I live, where you just go email somebody out of the blue; they'll spend time with you, they'll help you. Because it's really not zero sum; this isn't... As an entrepreneur, you're not trying to figure out some arbitrage investment theory that somebody else is going to go steal from you, like in the way that hedge funds might not share ideas like this with each other. Maybe they do. I don't know. But I mentioned, Max Levchin and I started the firm together. And that actually started when, I think I literally blind emailed him, saying, ""Hey. I like you. I like your history of what you've done. Why don't we meet to do this thing?"" And many brainstorms later, we ended up becoming friends, and doing this.But there are so many examples like that, where I was able to, I wouldn't call it punch above my weight class, because I wasn't punching above anything. I think it's that line of Death of a Salesman, ""I relied on the kindness of strangers"" to really situate me here, because I moved here in 2004. I knew nobody. I moved here because my wife kind of talked me into it. I was from Florida. I didn't want to move to California. And then, just a lot of kindness of strangers allowed me to meet some really incredible people, get some great ideas, and advanced my thinking. But I would have never gotten there, had I not just taken the initiative, but more importantly, had people not actually responded to my little easily deletable spam emails.",Parents,,Stranger,Took a chance,Acts of Service,

I loved hearing about Carlos' story from growing up in Brazil, to now running one of the largest businesses in the world. I hope you enjoy my conversation with Carlos Brito.
So Carlos, when I first heard your story it was at a charitable event that my wife helped put on called REACH Prep, here in Connecticut. And I was so interested in your personal story that while I don't normally start with someone's personal story, I think in this case I'd love to do so.","Carlos: [00:55:20] People that bet on me. People that believe that I could go places and decided to bet on me. I've always had mentors throughout my life and I always tell people when I go to colleges, again to recruit, if there was a really important thing in life is to have a great mentor. As you progress, you'll have different mentors. But to have great mentors, people that are willing to they're truly interested in your success and they are willing to take the risk to tell you in a constructive, respectful way what you need to hear, this is invaluable.And if you find people that are interested in your success and willing to tell you what you need to hear, this is gold because most people are afraid of telling you what you need to hear because they don't have that kind of relationship with you or they're not really interested in your success because they're afraid of competition because they have a role, whatever. So people that are great mentors, their goal, they're really good. But I think the kindest thing is really my family and the people that put up with me every day. At home, my wife and kids, my parents, I mean, they're the kindest people on earth.",Mentor,,,Took a chance,Acts of Service,

And every time you ask this question, I'm like, ""Man, so many people in my life have done nice things for me. How would I answer this question?"" And here we are. I actually have to think about how I want to answer it. I'll answer it like this. I've had a lot of people do a lot of nice things for me in my life, and I don't think I could pick the one king of it all. But one thing that stood out to me was the fact that I actually started my career in finance. I did investment banking and then moved into private equity. And I was on this track to make a lot of money, frankly. But I really didn't like the job and it was pretty soul-sucking for me. I wanted to be building something instead. And when my wife married me, I was in finance on this track to make us a lot of money. And when I wanted to quit, I talked to her about it and she was super supportive of me taking literally a 50% pay cut to go work a random job at a start-up in operations, just because I wanted to be building something.

And that obviously started me on the train that got me to being CEO and co-founder of Casa and building something that can have real impact around the world. Her initial support of me and giving me that push to do something that I was really passionate about, even though it affected both of us financially and was a little bit of a risk from a perspective of is this even going to be a solid job was huge.

One of my mentors, Jerry Held, saw me as a working mom with three kids come out of a really tough... my second startup that I did, we had a rough couple of years, and when I got out of it, we got together and he said, ""What are you going to do next?"" And I said, ""Jerry, I'm really enjoying just being with my kids for a few months. I'm thinking maybe I'm not going back.""And he really stuck his neck out and said, ""You're really good at what you do, you light up in the room, you love what you do."" He's older than I am. He's like, ""I see how this movie plays out. You'll be more interesting to yourself, your husband, your kids, you're going to be happier."" And I was fighting him, so it would have been easy for him to just say, ""Okay, okay, okay."" I was like, ""No, no, no, my kids need me, blah, blah, blah,"" and he really put his neck out and said, ""I would argue in the moment, the unpopular thing."" He was right.Once it sank in, I took my self, came back out, and you can hear that I love what I do so very much, and you heard me when we were talking earlier, it really impacts my relationship with my kids, my husband, etc. Jerry Held was right. And the kind thing was, and I try to do this with all the people I work with, is really challenge other people, because it's easy to cheer, and we all have cheerleaders, and it's the path of least resistance, but the way I try to show up as investors, the way he showed up for me, which is if I can open up your world and let you see things a little bit different that's better, that's the kindest thing.",Mentor,,,Mentorship,Words of Affirmation,

I'm going to probably over answer the question, I'll try to be brief per. Generally speaking, I have to say, my mom is the kindest person. Always provided a warm environment to come home from school in, and by the way that this was in outside Chicago and little town in Wisconsin, and there was nothing technology involved. That support was critical. The second personal one is my wife saying, ""Yes,"" 31 years ago. She is the best person I know, and I way over achieved, so that is good. She looked kindly upon me at the time. And then I would say, actually started working when I was 11, there was a woman that hired me, Mrs. Gunnerson, when I was a young kid to work 20 hours a week, which helped install a good work ethic. Guy named Dick Strong, who gave me my first office job in 1981 in Milwaukee, the Strong, Cornelius and Funds at the time, my professor Dave [Brophy] of Michigan, as I was kind of wandering aimlessly through my business school career, after wandering aimlessly through my undergrad career, got me interested in investments.",Mother,,Wife,Support,Acts of Service,

Well, I think the kindest thing anybody's ever done is Nina Singh, who I met when she was 17, when she was a freshman at Carnegie Mellon, but didn't marry me until 10 or 12 years later. She believed in me when there wasn't a lot to believe in. And I think had to be kindness because it certainly wasn't intelligence. You know what I mean? I think that sometimes the most basic things are the things that matter the most. Being super happily married and having a partner and a friend in life like Nina has been extraordinary. I mean, she's my film partner too. She's a brilliant filmmaker. I would have never, ever made Icarus or certainly ever won The Academy Award were it not for Nina coaching me on how to do it. I had some skill myself, but I wouldn't have been able to accomplish it at that level. And Nina's ability to keep me and others focused on the social mission of social justice, just an amazing thing.We did The Vow with great filmmakers from others, Karim, Jehane made the show with us, and it's a story about this cult in upstate New York, the NXIVM Cult and the way that Nina does things is she normally produced the film with Karim and Jehane, but then she made sure that the despicable founder of NXIVM, this guy, Keith Raniere got prosecuted and he's doing 99 years in jail with no parole. It wasn't good enough to make a really good series, we had to follow it through to the nth degree because our mission is not making great films, it's making great films that tell you something you need to know that leads to action and social justice. And what could it be better than taking a bad hombre and throwing him in the slammer for 99 years? So, that purity to mission has been an incredible guiding principle. So, that was one of the kindest things.The second thing is, interesting, it's this guy that I brought up twice named Jim Swartz, who Accel, is another venture firm. They are good friends of ours, but they compete with us. I don't think a lot of the decisions that I would have been able to make, I would have made without Jim's guidance and wisdom, even though he didn't have to do it. He runs another firm, but he did it. I thought that was amazing, and he's also the great part. What I'm always touched by is, there's so many people that have been helpful to me. I have such a non-jaded view of the world that way. I would have never, ever been successful ever, ever been able to do a lot of things I've done if it weren't for the kindness and generosity of people. Sometimes deserving, sometimes I wasn't, but it was through that, and by the way, that's empowered me to try to live my mission of doing the things that you and I've just talked about. Yeah, pay it forward. And you know what? It is through the effort of others.First of all, I have two isms that matter to me. One is that adversity does not teach character, reveals it. The other one is, no one's spared. Everybody has bad shit that goes on in their lives, their marriages, their kids, their friendships, their businesses, everything. Any of us that have such a pollyanna, that that isn't going to happen, or hasn't happened. It's just dead wrong. What you want is the ability to say, ""Hey, this happened. Help me."" And have people around you that have the empathy, and what that does is it builds up this sense that there's a common good of being able to be there for others. So if I were to take what people have done for me, which answers your question and say, ""Okay, how do I pay it forward?"" And make GC a firm that has at its core, the fact that we need to have empathy and understanding for that journey of founders. It's a pretty good role.",Wife,,,Marriage,Acts of Service,

First of all, Bob Wilmouth who chaired the investment committee and really hired me another day, and was just so kind to me and my team always, and supportive and helpful.

And I hope to do that.Roseanne: [00:57:04] The first thing I went to were like, well, which one do I pick? Somebody who told me that I could do something that I wanted to do.

Larry and Eric and even Bill Campbell, they all saw potential in me and gave me opportunities that bluntly, I just wasn't qualified for at the time. But they believed in my ability to rise up to those kinds of challenge. And as a leader, that is the bar that I hold for myself, which is see potential, expect more, and be active participant in the feedback.Bill would give me a hard time about all kinds of things, but he would also know exactly which grade my kids were in and what they cared about. So there was just that element of investment that came along with the belief. It was an active state of mind. There was not someone vaguely saying, ""Yes, yes, Patrick, you'll be a billionaire,"" and walking away. It was the active, committed engagement.

And I think in some ways, when you're new in this, spending the time to mentor someone is the kindest thing you can do for someone. Spend the time, but also say it like it is, give me really harsh feedback, and honestly, continuously push me into harder and harder jobs. They saw me as a lot more capable faster than I ever saw myself. I think that is the kindest thing instead of things you can do for someone. Spend the time, mentor them, give them real feedback, and see the potential in them they don't even see themselves yet.",Boss,,,Mentorship,Acts of Service,

I'm not sure if this is the kindest thing anybody's ever done for me, but it was surprising to see some of my former students have made really touching images or videos. Like people who I got into Bitcoin in 2013, I taught this class that had 250,000 students and had Bitcoin tutorials in there. Bitcoin was like at 60 bucks. Some people had their life just totally changed by that. They've done very kind things over the years, sent me really nice messages. They're like, ""I was at X and now I'm at Y. Thank you."" Just very unexpected gratitude because all I just did was type some stuff online that I knew. I didn't realize it had this positive impact on people.

Let me generalize it out, because I get super nervous and rattled when I have to talk about emotional things, as an engineer. The most amazing thing about the Silicon Valley ethos that people in the Valley all get and understand and people outside the Valley really don't get, and then I hear it all the time from people who come to the Valley, from people who come from LA or New York or DC, and they come to the Valley and they join one of these companies, they become part of this ecosystem, you always hear the same thing three years later, which is, I never realized what it would be like to be in an environment in which people genuinely want to help each other.They genuinely want to help each other advance in their careers in a way where it's not out of, because they want something from you in the moment. It's not because they have some hidden agenda. But every entrepreneur has experienced this. You know, I'm starting a company, it's like people come out of the woodwork and say, ""Hey, can I help? Can I send you my friends? Can I do this? Can I introduce you to this investor? You're having a security issue. Can I come in this weekend and help you figure it out?"" There's this incredible pay it forward ethic to the whole thing.My Hollywood friends, always, they know about this. They're always laughing because it's like Hollywood is famously the exact opposite. If there are two people in Hollywood and they're friends and each of them is trying to make a movie, the famous thing is one of them will happily knife the other. They'd rather lose the friendship than see their friend make the movie.Anyway, so I've been a beneficiary of this for a long time. I think part of it is just it's in the water. It's the pay it forward thing, which is other people have been nice and supportive to you and so you feel an obligation to contribute. But also a big part of it, and this goes back to this frontier concept, a big part is the sense of unbounded future possibility. So like in Hollywood, the reason why they're so mad at each other all the time is because there's only so much financing for so many movies. There's a very large number of people who want to make movies. There's only a small number of movies that are going to get made. And so basically it's like a zero sum kind of mentality.In the Valley, there's no practical limit on the number of new ideas for tech and there's no practical limit on the number of new startups. And by the way, there's no practical limit on the number of people who can participate. There's no practical limit on the number of people who can learn to write code, learn to do all the other things involved in building these companies. And so there's this sense and a track record that validates this, there's this sense of there's no limit. If I have a friend, and his startup succeeds, mine can also succeed. And in fact, we might succeed together. In fact, we might really help each other along the way. It's a positive sum view of the world.And then you just look at the history of the industry. That's how it's worked. For a place that's so kind of hyper capitalist and aggressive and sharp edged, it's just an amazingly helpful, supportive, happy, generous environment. I'd just say, yeah, I've been a big beneficiary of that for a very long time. And I try to, as best I can, to do that.",Mentor,,,Support,Acts of Service,

I hope you enjoy this great conversation with Howard Marks.","Howard: [00:53:46] I'm lucky because I've been the beneficiary of many acts of kindness. I think that in trying to think of one concrete one, I'll take the example, and it's germane to our discussion today, of the fact that in 2009, I believe, I wrote a memo in which I mentioned Warren Buffett, with whom I had a nice relationship at the time. I sent him a copy of the memo, and I said, ""I want to make sure you saw this."" He wrote me back. He says, ""Of course I read it, and if you ever decide to write a book, I'll give you a blurb for the jacket.""I had always been planning to turn the memos into a book when I retired, whenever that would be, but given Buffett's promise, I said, ""No, this is something I better cash now."" I wrote The Most Important Thing, over the next year. He gave me two blurbs on the front. It says, ""This is that rarity, a useful book,"" and then at the back, it says, ""When I see memos from Howard Marks in my inbox, they're the first thing I read and that goes double for this book,"" or something like that. The book was a huge seller. It sold well over a million copies, more than half of them in China. I was saying, ""In China, they think I am Warren Buffett."" They don't understand this Buffett's writing about me. But the point is that I wouldn't have written that book at that time without Warren's encouragement, and it brought me a lot of happiness. I think that's the most concrete example I can give you. As I say, I've been the beneficiary of many acts of kindness.",Peer,,,Support,,

That's a gift that my wife and I have really tried hard to give to our kids because it's a tough world. Stuff just goes wrong all the time. You make mistakes. Fate can be brutal. And to have a place you can go and people you can go to where no matter what happens they love you, it's like a warm blanket.When I was early in my career, I was looking for some career advice. And I was lucky through another family member to get a meeting with Michael Steinhardt, a long, long time ago when he was still in business. At the end of the conversation, I sort of asked him for some just general advice. And he said, ""Just marry the right girl."" He said, ""You can pretty much screw everything else up in life if you get that one decision right."" And he was onto something there.

I was just a tester who kept getting fired because I was annoying. Thought he knew everything. And this guy kept going to new places and kept hiring me over and over and over and over again, until he got fired or laid off from every place so I just had to start my own thing. It's the real reason you start a company is because nobody will hire you.And then you've got to convince all the VCs you're likable afterward. That's the challenge. No one will hire me, but I'm likable. Without him, I wouldn't be where I am today. So I like to try to do the same for younger kids. But that guy really changed my life.

Dennis Lynch,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/40040980/lynch-delivering-alpha-in-adapting-markets?tab=transcript,"My guest today is Dennis Lynch, Head of Counterpoint Global, where he oversees over a $100 billion in assets under management and boasts one of the strongest track records of any public investor operating today and having perhaps delivered as much or more dollar alpha to his investors as anyone I've had on the show before. In our conversation, we covered Dennis's unique approach to building a research team, how misclassification of companies often creates the highest upside opportunities and how Dennis has adapted his investment process over the last 20 years. I think Dennis defines what it means to be intellectually honest. And you will hear that in his answers throughout our discussion. I hope you enjoy this great conversation with Dennis Lynch.
So Dennis, after our original conversation many months ago, I've been toying with how to sort of structure this conversation, which is going to be a lot of fun. I thought a neat way to do that would be to ask this question, if you were teaching a class of 10 students, let's say these students were all high aptitude, super curious, wanted to be investors and you knew that at the end of a semester long course you had to hire all 10 of them to be on your team, how would you structure the syllabus of that course?","Dennis: [01:04:25] About four years ago, our family found ourselves suddenly in a health crisis. And the first thing you find out when you're dealing a lot with the healthcare system is that there are just so many really great well-intentioned people, whether they're doctors or nurses or people that are working at hospitals, et cetera, that's generally an uplifting thing. But the second thing you also find when you're dealing with the healthcare system in a really urgent and regular manner is that it's a big system and there's a lot going on. And despite all the well-intentioned people involved, it's up to you to take some ownership about your situation. And so maybe because of my analyst type background investor, my role in this situation really quickly became to be kind of patient advocate trying to make sure we understood everything happening and why it made sense and making sure the right things happened each time we were interfacing with the healthcare system. And in that process, I wound up cold emailing or cold calling a person who was working on a national protocol for a new trial or treatment for what we're dealing with and this person had no incentive and she wound up being way across the country geographically. And we had no relationships in common. I didn't know this person. They didn't know me or anything like that. So she wound up getting back to me very quickly and then spending just an enormous amount of time helping me as an analyst type to understand the situation and helped me feel comfortable with all the decisions we needed to make. And there was zero incentive for her to do that other than that she cared about people and she certainly in the right field. And I think when you can find people that do the right thing regardless of incentive, you've discovered something very special. So Dr. Karen, I just want to shout out to her for her support and counsel, but it is also symbolic of so many of the other people that we've experienced in the wider health care effort and system.",Doctor,,,Counsel,,

So Brent, the last time we did this on the record, although we've probably talked a hundred times since, was in the depths of COVID and concerns over its impact on the economy. And I was doing this series with ... I tried to get someone from every part of the market, from credit, from public equities, with you on private equities. And I think it would be fair to characterize that last conversation as pretty dour and dire, that we were both really concerned about the knock on effects that COVID might have. And here we are basically a year later, and I think it's gone about as well from an economic standpoint as we ever could have hoped in our bull case last year. I'd love you to begin by describing why you think that is. From your seat, you see a ton of businesses, a ton of sort of main street businesses all across the country.

So, Eli, I think the right framing for our discussion, given the wide variety of your background and your work, is what we'll call the great stagnation. I'd love you to describe this problem, maybe introduce concepts like GDP or total factor productivity, ways of measuring what we'll call a stagnation.

So, I'm thinking about like when I was blogging early in my career, people would go out of their way to promote my work or something like that. That is, to me, set up...

As I was thinking about that question last night, I was thinking a lot about family. And my husband and I are in the process of starting a family. And I think about I would have to say the kindest thing anyone's ever done for me is the sacrifice my parents made to alternating, pausing their careers to raise my siblings and me. I think about how challenging that decision probably was as someone who was I imagine equally as ambitious as I was to say, ""I'm going to put my child's needs ahead of my own ambition."" And I think about how impactful that gift of kindness has been on my life. They taught me to be inquisitive, to question why the world is the way it is. They taught me a thirst for learning. But ultimately, they gave me the greatest gift of all, which is unconditional love.When you have unconditional love, it's a level of security that is irreplaceable. It allows you to take risks. When I know that my parents, my husband, my family loves me, I can decide to start a firm at 27 years old and be totally comfortable with the fact that I might fail.

It was a much more fringe thing back in 2010 to not go to college and to Silicon Valley than it is today. It probably made no sense to them. It was what I wanted to do, and I think consistently throughout my life, they have just given me the freedom to both fail and to do I wanted.

Paul, increasingly we're thinking about these things as sort of like primers on big topics.

I've decided that kindness can't be something where it was mutually beneficial. There are a lot of things in my career that were kind, but the other person benefited from it as well. So I've decided that the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for me in my career where they had zero upside for doing this was when I was back at Pricewaterhouse Cooper. I was there right after the merger between Coopers and Lybrand and Pricewaterhouse. So I was the first class that was not a legacy PW or legacy Coopers and Lybrand person, which is interesting because culturally, those two firms are very different. So I didn't have a specific team I was assigned to. And they used to sort of fight over who got the new analysts that came in. And the partner on the Coopers and Lybrand side was a guy by the name of Rich Klein. And after a couple of years when I went into his office and I said, ""I'm thinking about making a change. This isn't for me. There's just something missing."" And we walked through it and he said, ""Well, okay. Well, what are you going to do?"" And I told him I was quitting to go work at a law firm, doing the taxation of sale-leaseback transactions for capital equipment. And he very astutely was like, ""You're doing that for the money. Those are the highest-paid junior lawyers at any firm because it's the worst work. Go sit at your desk for six months, read, explore, do whatever you need to do, but do not leave this for what it isn't. Go to the next thing for what it is, or you will spend the rest of your career jumping around from thing to thing."" I repeat that advice as often as I can to people that are struggling with the same question. And I think about it in terms of relationships, I think about it, ""It's okay to be single. Don't jump into a new relationship because your old relationship stinks. Don't take a new job that is mediocre because your old job stinks. Whatever you're doing, go and do it for what it is not because of what the old thing wasn't.""

We cover it all, base protocols, DeFi, NFTs, social coins, and the future of the internet. I hope you enjoy this wide ranging and fascinating conversation with Chris Dixon.
So Chris, I think the best place to begin probably would be for you to outline what I'll call your overall thesis or sort of philosophy of investing in the cryptocurrency space. You've been doing it for a long time. I think it's a comprehensive approach. You're not just attacking one part of the ecosystem. So maybe just frame this whole thing up for us to begin and then we'll dive in into the details.",Question not found,,,,,,

Many think of TCG as some of the best media and technology investors in the world, and in this discussion you'll quickly see why. In our conversation we cover how TCG identifies creators that they can help build businesses with, how established companies should think about influencers and media today, and what innovations they are most excited about in the creator space. As I become more heavily involved in building new media properties, Jesse and Mike have always been my first call for advice, so I'm excited to share this with you. Please enjoy my conversation with Jesse Jacobs and Mike Kerns.","Mike: [01:04:09] Unquestionably Ron Conway having met me through a family connection and me graduating undergrad, looking for really an introduction to just one of his portfolio companies was my only ask. Him spending three meetings with me, after the third meeting, sending me nine emails in a row. The first eight emails were, ""Read this, read this, read this, read this,"" and it was Red Herring, Industry Standard, Business 2.0, at least things people were reading in 1999, and the ninth email was, ""We want you to come work at Angel Investors,"" And unquestionably accelerated my career and opened my eyes up to this entire world and I'm forever grateful and he's still a friend and it really changed my life. Watching him work 24/7 for the other 199 plus portfolio companies that were not Google, most of which were going to end up zeros due to the 2001 crash and now seeing him two decades later having invested in Stripe, Airbnb, Dropbox, Pinterest, Snapchat, Coinbase, what he hasn't invested in impacted and being there, carrying around his emails for a couple of years because he was kind enough to take the time to invest in me was definitely the biggest thank you I'd give.",Boss,,,,,

Before founding Kindred Ventures, Kanyi was a general partner at Collaborative Fund. In our conversation, we discussed the parallels between today and the Roaring Twenties of the last century, the misunderstood risk curve of seed investing, and a deep dive into how Kanyi evaluates founders and businesses at the earliest stage of company formation. We also discussed Kanyi's experience teaching the Design Your Life Class at Stanford, and how some of those principles convinced him to take the leap to start his own fund. I hope you enjoy my conversation with Kanyi Maqubela.","Kanyi: [01:07:57] The kindest thing that anyone's ever done for me was actually done for my parents, but I was there and so I'm borrowing it. The US Ambassador to Botswana in 1986 sent his child to a boarding school in Gaborone, Botswana where my dad was a chemistry teacher. And we were in exile at the time from apartheid South Africa and were looking to get on asylum lists in places very far from South Africa. And the United States was very, very hard to get into as a South African. It was hard because the political relationship between apartheid South Africa and the Reagan Administration was one that didn't particularly lend itself to a lot of refugees. The US Ambassador to Botswana got us on a list. And he got us on a list and set us up with the Hebrew International Aid Society, which had obviously built its legacy repatriating and also saving the Holocaust refugees, but they were expanding their purview a bit. And so we got set up with them by this list and got to arrive in New York City at JFK with a thousand dollar zero-interest loan and a chance at building a life in America.

With all the hype surrounding NFTs and given Jesse's background in the music industry and his focus on the creator and ownership economy, he's the perfect person to teach us about the future of NFTs. We discussed the basics of what an NFT is, what new creative paradigms they may unlock, and where we are in the NFT hype cycle. This episode is the first in what will likely become its own show that we are calling primers. Our goal for primers is to bring investors and operators from a zero to a seven understanding of a topic, concept, or industry. The goal here is for the education around these topics to be fast and entertaining. I hope you enjoy this discussion with Jesse Walden and hopefully the first of many primers to come. Our mission with these episodes is to provide access to the best ideas and people in business and investing. We will soon be significantly expanding the scope of this effort. To make it possible at Colossus, we're expanding the team and hiring two critical early roles. The first position will be our lead mobile software developer. This person will lead the development of our mobile applications, which will change how people learn together. The second position will be our lead designer. Because the existing team lacks UX and UI design experience, this person will have a blank slate to creatively design new applications from the ground up.

And I've been struggling with it ever since.Josh: [01:24:05] That was the kindest thing. The kindness thing was Josh giving you the heads up.Tony: [01:24:09] I've wrestled with it ever since he said, be prepared for this. I have been blessed by so many incredible mentors, and my parents all the way up to the countless mentors and teammates. So I was going down that tangent, but actually the more I thought about the kindest thing, I would chalk up and not attribute it to one individual, are the number of folks who forgave my transgressions, forgave my passion, my temperament, and allowed me to make mistakes and recover from them and move on. So it's a broader kind of hand wave for the kindest thing. I feel so very grateful that I was able to fumble through a lot of situations and figure it out ultimately, I hope, to a successful level. But that didn't happen without people saying, ""Oh boy, give him a little more rope."" Opened the door, they pulled me in and said, ""You could have screwed that up a little harder, but you might have had to try,"" but they then allowed me to recock and get back at it.",,,,Forgiveness,,

I wake up every day and slap my hands together. It doesn't work because I'm a good coach. It works because there are people that allow me access to them, that allow me into their hearts and into their minds, and that's probably the thing I'm most grateful for and probably the kindest thing anyone has ever done to me. Anytime someone calls me coach and allows me to coach them, get them from where they are to where they want to be, and there's some dragging and pushing and pulling and all that typically, I'm really grateful for that.",Players,,,Receiving mentorship,,

His company was acquired by Adobe in 2012, where he is currently the chief product officer. In this conversation, we cover the importance of focusing on the first mile of a customer's experience with your product, why every user is (at first) either lazy, vain or selfish, and what the rise of creativity tools means for creators and investors in the future. We also cover the major trends that Scott thinks will dominate for the next decade. This was one of those conversations where I was left with 10 great lessons that will stick with me for a long time. Please enjoy my conversation with Scott Belsky.
So Scott, I've been so excited to do this with you. I think we'll make the first part of this conversation about the psychology and process of building great products. And then we'll talk a lot about everything else that you do. You have your hands in so many interesting things. My opening question, I guess, is just very broad, which is what is your philosophy of building great products, generally speaking?","Scott: [00:52:12] I think the kindest thing is really to make time when there's clearly nothing in it for them. And we all now know when you get into a point in your career where you start getting a lot of inbound stuff, you sort of start to filter it all out. And it's like, ""Oh, I need to stay focused on my family and make sure that I do what's absolutely necessary at work, and take the occasional opportunity when it comes from a really great source,"" and then you start to close everything else out. But when I look back, I remember certain people who were really great leaders in the industry who made time for a kid in high school, in some cases, or in business school. And so now I realize just how kind that was, how kind of selfless it was. It was sort of a pay-it-forward motion, I guess, and I challenged myself to somehow prioritize that even when it becomes a little less easy to do so.",Mentor,,,Made time,,

So I guess I'll say, you know, after really the hardest year of my life, the thing that I'm continually thinking about more, not to steal your thunder, is what is just the most recent kind thing someone did for me. That is something that we don't think enough about. We think three years later, wow, it was amazing that my boss gave me the chance to do this. We don't think yesterday, one of my friends woke up at 7:00 AM and had a call with me to talk through a bunch of stuff that I wanted to talk through.Over the past couple of days, I've had a bunch of different calls with friends early in the morning and in my life, I've had times where in the moment I've said, ""Hey, I need to chat. I need to talk,"" and have dropped everything and gone. And those are the kindest things people have done, things they have done for me.

I hope you enjoy this great conversation with Joost van Dreunen.","Joost: [00:57:21] My company started really with this wild idea because I wasn't sure what to do. I had just come out of grad school and I had sort of lost my own way. The thing is, is that you grew up in a world where you end up thinking about how to be in that world. So, you start a business. Do you take a job? Where do you go from here? One of the kindest things that anyone's ever done for me was a doctor at Columbia University. So, I was diagnosed in 2007 with cancer. It was her, I won't say her name because I don't want to embarrass her, but she was the one who said, ""Look, you need to go get this checked out and you need to upgrade your insurance. And if it's nothing, then you'll spend a little extra money. If it's something, then you're going to save yourself a whole rigmarole.""So, I went through a whole medical thing for like a year, costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, which I didn't pay because she told me to think about this. And it wasn't so much about saving the money, but it was about someone who's like, ""Let me look out for you."" And so, since then, as I was starting to think about what to do, I always try to honor that idea of what's best for you. And I think it's, in building businesses or talking to my students, going through the pandemic over the last semester, I try to kind of channel that, pay that forward, by saying like, ""Let me just empathize with your circumstance a little bit and how can we be together?"" But that was really such a helpful, beautiful person to help me at that moment. So, that was one of the kindest things back then, which was meaningful to me.",Doctor,,,Counsel,,

When my husband, Rick and I moved to Houston after graduate school, we didn't know many other married young people and we met these two couples that really went out of their way to pull us into their orbit. One was Taiwanese and the other was mixed heritage, South Indian. They really welcomed us fully into not just their own lives, but those of their extended families.

So pretty soon, we were joining them for these very intimate religious and cultural rites of passage learning from their parents who were in their 70s about the professional practices that were at the heart of their cultures, the personal practices. They embraced us. We coined this term that we call framily. More than friends, adopted as family. So today, I've had this fortune of working across so many different languages and cultures, countries. When I think back to the most important lessons and by far the most important skills about adapting and developing Guanxi, the act of building trust or about Chinese or about karaoke. So many of those intangibles that help you build teams and find value and build a business. They track back to those initial gifts. And for that, I will always be grateful.",Neighbor,,,Friendship,,

So, Ram, I think we have to set the stage here with the broadest description of the opportunity that you see in front of us as you can. I'll call this the commercial internet, maybe you could just describe what that phrase means to you, why you think it represents the size of the opportunity that it does.","Ram: [01:17:28] And I love the way you ask this question every single time. And in fact, sometimes I just forward to the end of the podcast, and ignore the content. But I'll tell you listen, and it's obviously, starting a firm has been front and foremost to me. This is my third baby right now, after my kids. The kindest thing I'm going to point out is there's this gentleman called, he works at Greylock, his name is Asheem Chandna. He's a very under the radar, but a brilliant, brilliant venture investor, one of the best in the world, by the way. And I met him serendipitously, I'd say 12 months ago, we had a quick discussion. And I said to him I was starting a firm, and literally on the spot, he committed his first check, like literally he was my first money in when I knew him for 45 minutes.I'm not sure what he saw in me, but he saw something. So especially with the context of building a firm in the early days, where you're not quite sure whether there are so many reasons to fail, when a kindness of a stranger comes in. And Asheem in this case, and he's now become a dear friend, obviously, committing a few million dollars to you in 45 minutes. I think that really from a company building perspective, the money is a token, but he gave me the confidence that I could go and raise capital, which is always the hard part about bootstrapping a firm. And so I would say that in the last 12 months, the most contemporary kind thing somebody has done for me is what Asheem did, and he literally helped me on my way to starting a firm.",Mentor,,,Took a chance,,

I'm not going to say my mom because I will tell you that, in my view, she's a saint. But I won't say anything about my mom, which literally she is top of the list. But I talked to you about Chris Murphy and Jay Jordan. Both of those two have done things that are so kind to me and really changed the trajectory of my thinking, which then ultimately has led to my career and life and has changed my family.I got a meeting with Chris Murphy very early in my career. It was the first time we would ever meet. He is the chairman of 1st Source Bank, which is a regional, public-traded bank here in South Bend. He agreed to a meeting. It was a Friday and the meeting was scheduled at 2:00. Again, I knew nothing. I knew nothing about business. I was really just pretty green. I was in that earliest stage. I'm probably 22, 23 years old. I go into his office and immediately he says, ""Hey, I can't do this meeting right now. I got to go."" I had waited for a long time to get this meeting. He said, ""What are you doing right now?"" I said, ""I'm doing nothing. I had this meeting scheduled."" We got on his plane and we flew to Naples, Florida. I spent 7 days with him and his family. Now, we had never met before this meeting. During that 7 days, I also met another guy, Basil Sellers, from Australia who's a very successful guy. I got 7 days of what I think was the best lessons that I could ever get. It was so kind. He was so kind. His family was so kind. That relationship has lasted now for nearly 25 years we're going on. That was the kindest thing.And then Jay Jordan did a very similar thing. We went to the Hamptons. I will tell you that it changed my life in ways that I never thought about at the time. I think it's a metaphor for just giving a kid access and letting him see the world differently than they've ever seen the world and the impact that it could make on a kid just being able to see it, being able to see Naples, Florida. For me, that was a big deal. Today I've been to Naples many times, but back then I had never been to a place like that and certainly not the Hamptons and just giving me that exposure, I think my family would say was one of the nicest things that they've ever did because I think it changed generations of my family just having that. That's the nicest thing. That's a long story, but it's near and dear to me. Both those people continue to be very important in my life. They might say, ""I've done 50 of those nice things for you, Tracy."" I could hear Jay answering that question. It would be fun to hear him answer the question.",Mentor,,,Mentorship,,

And I had a job, I had my first job it was Mario Gabelli, still around today picking stocks.

I didn't have any money, I couldn't afford rent.Now my friend was doing an internship, he wasn't even in town, but he was like: ""You can live with my parents."" So Pleasantville's in Westchester. So Stan and Myra Jaffe open their house to me, with their son not even there. I moved in and lived in the basement with the parents of my friend.

Danny Meyer,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/21049021/meyer-the-power-of-hospitality?tab=transcript,"My guest today is Danny Meyer, the founder and CEO of Union Square Hospitality Group, which compromises some of the most acclaimed restaurants in New York City like Gramercy Tavern and Union Square Cafe. Danny is also the founder and chairman of Shake Shack, which began in New York City, but is now a publicly traded company with hundreds of locations worldwide.
Our conversation focuses on how great hospitality leads to great business, regardless of the sector that it's in. We discuss why hospitality is the starting point for Danny's business philosophy, why first impressions matter, Danny's concept of ABCD, which stands for Always Be Connecting Dots, how to scale hospitality, and how to build a business with essentialism and soul.","Danny: [00:48:56] Kindest thing anyone's ever done for me was to say yes when I asked her to marry me. I just cannot imagine any of my business life or family life or who I've become had it not been for Audrey Heffernan saying yes and becoming Audrey Heffernan Meyer. She is an amazing mom of four kids, who I adore, who I learn so much from, and probably more than anything, in addition to the, ""Isn't it great how she has supported me,"" which it is, but she's I think more than anything helped me to become real. I think there's a fine line between wanting people to be happy so much that you end up losing a piece of your own authenticity. And that never happened to me, thank goodness. And I give her all the credit for that.",Wife,,,Marriage,,

I have a bit of a recency bias, but something that's been on my mind almost every single day. A couple of weekends ago, I drove my car to the middle of nowhere in California. It was pretty warm. Parked my car on the side of the road. I don't really pay attention to where I parked it. I locked my door, put my keys in my pocket, and I got out for a run. I come back to the car, 12, 14 miles later, pretty dehydrated. Didn't bring any water with me. It's maybe 95 degrees. I'm pretty excited to get into the car, turn on the air conditioning, drink some water, and get back home. I then discovered that the car had sunk into the ground a little bit. It's very thin sand. I turn on the car, and start the engine, and hit the gas, and dig a great ditch for myself.

Situation becomes a little bit more alarming when I realize the car has almost no fuel left, literally, in middle of nowhere in California. I really treated myself here. I thought I was screwed, but it only took maybe, I don't know, 10, 12 minutes until someone's driving by on the road. They drive by and then they pass me, and then they turn around. Low and behold, over the course of the next 30, 40 minutes or so, three people stopped their car, turned around, and helped me tow my car out of the sand. To me, this was so simple, but so momentous for me. I truly had begun thinking, ""Well, this is basically it. I'm stuck here and I'm going to make camp here for the next three days."" But the fact that people went out of their way to help me, here's the interesting thing that I find in it. Now, every time I'm driving on any type of road, in particular, if it's desolate, and I see someone stuck, I have a real proclivity to try to help them because I was helped. I think that small effect, in many ways, describes the magic of Silicon Valley. Someone took a bet on me when I was 18 years old, and you see now in my career, I'm trying to take other bets on people. So there's a real pay-it-forward element, I think happens, to when you shower someone with an excessive amount of, with a surprising amount we should say, of effort  when they feel like they don't deserve it. So I don't know if it's the most kind thing people have done to me, but that's a pretty big one.",Stranger,,,Help in time of need,,

But right before I came, my mom said she was frantically searching for me because I had gone from our home and walked I guess a mile or two away on my own into the center of the village. Which is kind of bustling. It's like a big town. It's a lot. It's like a bizarre. And a merchant there recognized me because I used to come with my mom periodically and buy grains, or fruits, or whatever. And he entertained me basically for an hour, bought me all sorts of fruits and candies, and walked me back to my house. When my mom told me about it and said this gentleman just closed up his shop, entertained me for half a day, and brought me back home so that my mom who was frantically searching for me wouldn't completely lose it, I think it was a pretty kind thing.",Stranger,,,Help in time of need,,

So I was basically kind of armless as it were. Very difficult to do things on my own. And I was living by myself in Boulder. And I was really struggling I will say. Tough to really carry groceries or do things when you've got both arms that are injured. And I called up my sister, and she lives in Indianapolis. And I just said, ""Man, I'm really struggling. How far is Indianapolis from here?"" And she said, ""I'll look into flights right now and we can drive you back."" And it's like a 16 hour drive. And it actually ended up being my brother-in-law. My sister couldn't make it because she had a few appointments here. And he just jumped into plane, no questions asked. Just bought a plane ticket, got an SUV. Helped me pack my broken bike in my bike box, all my luggage, helping me with the open jars and all this type of stuff.

Enjoy this great conversation with Anu Hariharan.","Anu: [00:57:53] Well, there are a lot of people that have really helped me, but I think the kindest thing that comes to mind is Dr. Jeffrey Reed. He was my research advisor at Virginia Tech. I was doing my Master's in wireless communications. This was in 2002, right after 9/11. And the funding that most state universities got from the government was completely slashed. Even private funding was at an all-time low. So I had come with the hope of getting a research fellowship. The university and the research group had no money to be able to fund me.I come from a Tier-3 town in India. My parents were very middle class, and my dad had pretty much taken an entire loan against all his assets and could pay only for a year of my tuition. Come summer, and I was working enough in Virginia Tech to cover all my living expenses. But as an international student, you can work only 20 hours and you have to work in campus. You can't work outside. So there's only so much I could do. And I remember very vividly, this was July, and my dad basically said, ""Look, this is it. This is the last straw. Finish whatever credits you can, you're going to come back in August."" And I was like, ""Yeah, I get it.""And so I went to my advisor and said, ""Look, I really can't continue, and I need to find a way to graduate. So I should finish whatever credits I can in the summer, and maybe I could do it remotely. Would you be open to doing remotely?"" He asked me, ""How much money do you need?"" And I said, ""Well, I haven't paid tuition this month. I need to pay $1,200."" He took a checkbook, wrote a check, and gave it to me without any questions.

Well, I was thinking about this and there is an answer I could absolutely give you about my parents, because how could anyone ever do anything kinder than sacrifice years and years and years of their life in order to enable you to have a great one? But as much as I love my parents, I want to give a more sort of fun answer than a less cliche answer than I'm sure many guests before has.So I want to tell a fun story of my girlfriend and I going to Disneyland when that was still a thing before we couldn't do that anymore. It was her birthday and we really, really, really wanted to go to do the new Rise of the Resistance ride, which is for anyone who's never done it, which very few people have done it because it launched shortly before the shutdown. It is by far and away the coolest Disney experience ever and it is obviously... You kind of feel like you're in Star Wars. So for any Star Wars geek out there, it is an absolute must do thing. Did not win the luck of the draw on random sort of Wheel of Fortune thing that happens when the gates open to figure out if you're going to get in that day.And we were going to get to do it maybe a half hour before our flight if you were lucky. And through the incredible generosity of a guy who I won't say in case there's someone at Disneyland and he did something wrong, that gets him to trouble, so I won't name him. But it was a guy working there and despite the fact that there was a couple breakdowns during the day, we were not going to be able to get on it and we were going to have to get our flight. We basically made our case to him, explained that it was her birthday, he moved mountains for us, got around an incredible amount of red tape because they don't want people doing this, to get onto that ride immediately before having to run to the airport.And I will tell you, Patrick, when you were on our show, I talked about the thrill that comes from learning, the thrill that comes from that moment in my physics class when I discovered that orbit and me not being able to throw a baseball very far were related. I had like a similar high getting to go and do this Star Wars experience with my girlfriend when we thought we weren't going to and he put personal risk on the line to make this thing happen for us. It is the tiniest strangest little example. But it's a fairly recent one and it totally stuck with me. I just loved... He truly had no personal gain in doing that, and many kind things that people do. There's some amount of personal gain, this one had actually none.",Stranger,,,Got them on Disney ride ?,,

It is a bit of a departure from my normal investing conversation, but contains powerful lessons for many investors and builders. I really enjoyed our conversation and hope you will too.
Jacqueline, I've been so excited to do this with you. What we're going to talk about today is a bit of a departure from my normal investing conversations, but I suspect it will be one of the most interesting. I thought an interesting jump-off point would be to have you tell the audience the story of The Blue Sweater, the name of your first book, and I just think it's such a neat way to frame our conversation.","Jacqueline: [00:49:15] My husband said to me last night, ""You're never more alive and on fire than when you're sitting in a slum somewhere or with a small holder."" And as a result, and the reason for that is, I've seen people who have nothing, over and over want to give me everything, and I think about how little I give back. I could give you a thousand stories, but the one that just came to mind, we had a drip irrigation company. We would sell tiny bits of drip irrigation to small poor farmers, so that over time, as the drip irrigation improve their productivity, they could buy another piece of the drip irrigation and go from a quarter of an acre to a half, and so on and so on. And it was extraordinary.And I went to go visit this one farming family that had succeeded, and they lived in a lean-to tent, if you will. Just imagine the two sticks with a piece of tarp that float over. And I kept thinking, ""My God, in the monsoons, what do these people do?"" I mean, just that poor. But next to the tent was a concrete foundation for the house that they would build. And they could only afford the foundation so far from a drip irrigation that they had invested in, and were building new lives for themselves. But they were that poor. And the day was hot. It was like 121 degrees. So, I'm not exaggerating feeling hot. Imagine just living in a half tent. I had this group with me and we didn't bring any gifts. Everybody was really cranky and didn't really want to be there, but I felt obligated to be there. And was talking to the woman, and she was sharing her dreams, and you could see the house that she was going to build in her eyes as she spoke about it.And then she said, ""But you can't leave yet because I spent the whole morning cooking for you."" And I was like, ""Oh, please stop. No, no, no."" And sure enough, we go into this lean-to tent, or as many of us could fit in it, there were four of us, and she had prepared this lavish meal for us. And we sat on the ground and I thought, ""Here I am with truly someone who you would look at and think she has nothing in the world, but she won't let us leave until she treats us like gifts."" We talked about dignity, Patrick, and how much there is to learn from it. I guess it's that kind of story. And the food was delicious to die for.Oh, you tell that kind of story, and the fact that I have a thousand like that, and I think that is really what brought me in writing the book, to think not only about what is success and who are the most successful people? But does it have to be the richest, most powerful, the most famous? Or might it be those who do the most to release other people's energy and dignity in the world? And what if we moved away from a golden rule of do unto others as you would have them do unto yourself, to one that asked each of us to follow a simple metric, get more to the world than you take, as individuals, as families, as companies, as investors? When I first started trying to apply that to Acumen, can you really invest and give more than you extract?And the answer is yes, if you take that approach of doing everything in your power to make that person succeed, particularly if that person is driven by purpose to help other people succeed. Becomes a radical generosity that keeps coming back to you, kindness begetting kindness, but it's not just about being kind, it's also about being human and about sharing this Earth with each other.",Stranger,,,Gift,,impoverished person sharing the meal

And throughout my career there have been a number of mentors who have sort of lit a fire under me and you'll figure it out and you can do this and there are a handful of them and I would say I am forever grateful for the confidence that they had in me before I had the confidence in myself.

Rory Sutherland,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/64849045/sutherland-moonshots-and-marketing?tab=transcript,"So Rory, I really toyed with where to start in this conversation, and I figured a neat place would be this idea that a spreadsheet leaves no room for miracles, and that the problem with logic is that it kills off magic. I'd love you to expand on those two great ideas because in my world of finance, we use a lot of spreadsheets.","Rory: [00:47:37] Rory [45:25]:Oh, someone for our honeymoon, someone lent us, my wife and me, a Morgan sports car to drive around. It was Eileen Murphy. She gets a name check here because she lent us a sports car for my wife and me to drive around France for a week on our honeymoon. That was spectacular generosity, particularly as I was only about 23 at the time. Other things by the way, which create a huge amount of happiness are often surprisingly small. And I think that's one of the things we mustn't forget about kindness that it's, again, it's nonlinear, there are butterfly effects. Tiny little gestures like sending a card, in some ways, this is an interesting thing, which is: the very fact that the gesture is kind of unnecessary or that it's done in a way that's just slightly more laborious than is necessary, those little things I think give us a surprising amount of happiness in life.Other things by the way, which create a huge amount of happiness are often surprisingly small.

Michael is a partner at Y Combinator and the CEO of their startup accelerator. He was the co-founder and CEO of Justin.tv, which eventually became Twitch and Socialcam. In this conversation, we discuss all Michael has learned reviewing thousands of applications to YC, interviewing countless new entrepreneurs, and watching young companies begin to grow, and occasionally, finding product-market fit. Listeners will also enjoy when Michael traps me big time in my thinking about Airbnb and his framework for great problems to solve. Enjoy this great conversation with Michael Seibel.","Michael: [00:54:10] In 2006, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear sent an email to our friend group. Saying that, they were starting a new company and that they were taking a road trip from Cambridge, Massachusetts to San Francisco because they wanted to start their company in Silicon Valley. I was working on a US Senate campaign where we had just lost our primary by three percentage points. And I hadn't taken a vacation in a very long time. They were 22. I was 23, and I emailed them, and I asked them, “can I join you on your road trip?” And what they didn't tell me is they packed up Emmett's Civic with all their stuff. So to clear out a room in the car for me, they had to basically give away or throw away about a quarter of their stuff. And they said “yes.” And I wouldn't be here right now without that yes.",Friend,,,Made space in car,,

I asked them on to help the audience understand the open source software business model. I've been fascinated with this model in which companies give a huge chunk of their work and value away for free to a community of developers and then make money by building additional tools, functionality and services on top of their free and open platform. While this may strike you as a wonky discussion on a niche software topic, I think it is valuable for everyone because the ideas can be applied to more than just code.",Question not found,,,,,,

Stitch Fix is a multi-billion dollar public company, which has brought an entirely new model to retail apparel by combining data science, technology, and personal stylists, to create a unique shopping experience tailored to the individual consumer. I first met Katrina through past guest, Bill Gurley, and I've been excited to host her since that first meeting. In this conversation, Katrina and I discuss all aspects of Stitch Fix. It's history, business model, innovations and its future. Please enjoy this great and thought provoking conversation with Katrina Lake.
Katrina, I've been really excited to do this with you because the business that you've built occupies a space that everyone understands, which is the world of retail, clothes, eCommerce, something that's become increasingly important, especially during COVID. I thought a neat place to start before we get into the nitty gritty around Stitch Fix, specifically, is with the eCommerce landscape. I love reading in the most recent annual report to shareholders, about this next wave of eCommerce that you've envisioned and helped usher in. Could you outline your take on where we stand in eCommerce and what the future might hold?","[00:55:28] I can think of a couple of different parts of my life, and through this conversation, honestly, the one that probably stands out right at this moment is, when we were going public, it just was challenging. We were a company that weren't good comps out there, still probably aren't. I don't know that we had the most accurate view on what valuation would be like. The roadshow was tough, just the same challenges that we've had with investors in the private market, ended up being true in the public market too. The IPO was just tough, and I didn't personally know CEOs who had done it before. This is my first time doing it.I forget which day it was on the roadshow, but one of the later days on the roadshow, another public company CEO reached out to our bankers actually, and just said, ""Hey, I have no idea how things are going, but can you please let Katrina knows that she can call me? And that it might be tough and it might a tough week, or might whatever.""I called him. We'd never met before. He knew nothing about me, and he just reached out. Another act of kindness, the night before the IPO, I was crying. It was like 11:00 PM in the Midwest. I texted Sarah Friar, who was the CFO of Square, and was like, ""Can you talk?"" And talked to her and got a little pep talk from her. But I think in those moments, when you feel very alone, and as a CEO, there's a lot of moments where you feel somewhat alone, but this was one in particular. It was like, okay, other people who could empathize with a challenging set of circumstances before what, on the surface, is a really exciting event. I felt guilty for feeling sad before this momentous picture taking thing on the stock exchange event. But I think both of those moments of being able to talk to somebody who had been through this and somebody who reached out, and just to check in, knowing that that was a time of loneliness, it was just really, really kind.",Peer,,,Words of encouragement,,

The topic of our conversation is the future of cryptocurrency and decentralized finance. Its been a while since I checked in on the world of crypto and while prices are still below the 2017 highs, there’s been a ton of additional work and infrastructure laid. We discuss the major events of the past decade and what might happen in the 2020s. Perhaps most interesting, we cover the potential benefits of a modernized financial system, which Coinbase hopes to help usher in. As I’m trying to do more in conversation with CEOs, we also discuss the lessons he’s learned building a business. Please enjoy my conversation with Brian Armstrong.","Brian: [01:01:42] Well, I mean the first thing that comes to mind is what I said a little earlier, which is I was just a kid who was tinkering around with some kind of technology and I thought maybe I was crazy because nobody else seemed to think it was very cool. But I applied to Y Combinator and they wrote me that initial check. And I was like, ""Okay, maybe I'm not crazy."" It sounds so silly in hindsight, but I was afraid of calling my parents and telling them, ""Hey, by the way, I quit my job to go do this crazy thing."" If I could tell them, ""Well, somebody actually believes in me, because they wrote me this check,"" it gave me a little bit more confidence to go do it. So I think sometimes just taking a bet on somebody and seeing the potential in them, and I've tried to do that a few times with other people, can be like a really important gift for them.

Matthew Ball,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/69430337/ball-the-future-of-media-movies-the-metaverse-and-more?tab=transcript,": My guest today, Matthew Ball, is a long time coming. He's the former head of strategy at Amazon Studios, an investor, and probably my favorite business essayist writing today. In fact, I can't think of another author whose work I read as quickly once a new essay drops. Read his latest on the past and future of Nintendo and you'll see why. Our conversation is all about the past and future of media. We discuss movies, music, television, video games, and the meta-verse. When I re-listened to this episode, I couldn't believe how much information was in Matthew's head and how easily he covered so many topics in depth.
So Matthew, this conversation has been, I don't know, two years in the making. Luckily, in those two years you've written about 25 more interesting things that we might explore today, so I'm glad that we waited. I thought it'd be fun for those that aren't familiar with you to sort of sum up your compulsive interest, which I would define as how people entertain themselves. How would you describe your compulsive interest?","Matthew: [01:45:02]: I always love this question because I think, when you listen to your podcast, Patrick, you'd hear such a commonality of the number of people who gave you a break. I've certainly benefited from many, many people. Jason Hirschhorn, Jesse Jacobs. I'm sure I'm going to miss many people, but I think, the foundational one ultimately comes back to parents. I think my parents both grew up low income. They worked hard to become middle income and they gave my sister and I an upper middle class, if an upper-class upbringing of opportunity, often at their own disadvantage. Giving away luxury trips and so forth, choosing where we would go to school, what we would get, the books, the time with them.And I think extricating that from the success that has come, irrespective of hard work, opportunities other have given down the line, is just impossible. And I think that that's a gift that endures.",Parents,,,Sacrifice,,

Kat’s story and career trajectory are remarkable, as are the lessons she’s picked up along the way which she shares with us all in this conversation. We discuss negotiation, distribution, brand building, brand extension strategies, and leadership. I always enjoy have a true operator on the show, so I was very excited to discover Kat and her thinking. Please enjoy this great conversation.","Kat: [00:14:33] The first step is what I learned when I traveled to open restaurants around the world at such a young age and every time I went to a new country, it was a new team. I had never met them before. They had never met me. The concept was new to the country and so it was just a lot of new like a lot of firsts. And so I had to build trust very quickly. I was the leader leading a team I had never met who had to get to know each other, do a job, hire and train employees and managers, get the restaurant set up, get it open successfully, stay there for a week to make sure it was good, train trainers before we would leave so they could support themselves and then we're out in four weeks. And then another do it in another country and another team over and over.And that really forced me to build a muscle of learning to build trust quickly. And of learning as a leader, there is no alternative. To me, there was no option other than believing that the people I've got can do the job and that somehow subconsciously formed these little behaviors. Again, they became subconscious over time, but looking people in the eye if you're looking at them, making the time for them. The tone of voice saying, ""I'm so excited to hear what you have going on,"" as opposed to, ""Ugh, I'm so important and you're groveling.""It's mindset. First and foremost, it's mindset, and how people feel it. People are intuitive. They're empathic beings. They sense energy even through voice-only or a Zoom and certainly in person. And if you're belittling someone else in your mind, even if you think you're covering it, you're not. So it has to start with like genuinely believing there's something possible because that's going to show up in tone of voice and treatment of the individual and then beyond that, using literal words: “I believe there could be something here. I'm not sure. What do most people miss?”People are intuitive. They're empathic beings. They sense energy even through voice-only or a Zoom and certainly in person. And if you're belittling someone else in your mind, even if you think you're covering it, you're not.Flipping the question a little bit instead of “sell me like everybody else sells me” even though you may not have had near the resources or the support or the infrastructure, impress me like everybody else does. Of course, that's not typically going to happen consistently, but rather what do most people miss? What do others you've talked to not get about this that you understand? I want to know what's unique about your view.A phrase like that, a question like that indirectly says, ""I respect your perspective."" And so finding questions that are like that where you don't have to say, ""I'm different. I see you as what you might become."" It's more around evidencing that with showing humility and curiosity about a person and then having the courage to be honest with them if you have a question or a doubt, or a point of view because that builds trust as well. So I think it has a lot to do with specific questions and tone of voice and non-verbal cues that demonstrate reverence, and respect, and humility, and curiosity.",,,,,,

It's a lively and wide ranging conversation with one of the entrepreneurs I've most enjoyed speaking with. Please enjoy.
John, I think a fun place to begin this conversation would be probably unexpected to the audience, which is with industrial conglomerates. I'd love you to explain why you've been interested in industrial conglomerates in some of your research. And then I want to talk about some of these principles applied to technology companies, but first, explain why you're so interested in this interesting niche of public companies.","[01:15:54]You really set it up with a high bar when you say kindest to run an expensive query over a large data set there. I was reflecting on this. I grew up in Ireland. I spent all my years there until I moved out to the United States for college, and I feel very culturally Irish. And there's something about acts of kindness I've experienced with Irish people. It's maybe different to that I've experienced with Americans. And there's something about kind of the culture there, just to give you maybe two examples. One is, first moving out to San Francisco, the person we stayed with was an Irish guy. And the way we got to know him is a going away party at MIT. There was an Irish guy who came to the going away party. Didn't know, me and Pat we didn't know each other that well, but, oh, sure. You're going to San Francisco, you can stay with my brother.I mean, we had barely met the guy, never met his brother, but this guy Lorcan, very Irish name, was willing to let us stay at his place for a week. And so we got there and it wasn't one of his many guest rooms, get there as a studio apartment. And so he's like, ""Okay, you can take the bedroom."" And he sleeps on the couch. But that was, for me, kind of a very Irish act of kindness when first moving here or similarly, when I was in secondary school, we just had this incredibly understanding principle where we all this had various pursuits and weird things going on. And we know we were serious about academia, but we're taking maybe an unconventional path. And so this principal, a guy called Martin Wallace who's since passed away sadly, but he was always incredibly understanding that we had a path in mind that we wanted to take and it might not be fully aligned with all the rules that were written down that they had for running a secondary school.And so I just dropped out half a year of high school that I, more or less skipped when we were running on our previous technology company prior to Stripe. And he just kind of made it work despite the fact they had all their attendance requirements and things like that. He was willing to enable that because he felt like it was a good thing. Or in the case of Patrick, Patrick just decided to skip the Irish end of school exams and do the British ones as well because he could shortcut and go to college earlier. This kind of extremely benevolent oversize of us and flexibility and understanding in a very unassuming and quiet way where it never really came up as a big thing. He almost assumes that, of course, I want to enable you on the path that you want to be on, even if it makes my life hard and it's extremely different to what I might be used to.And so, as I think a lot of the acts of kindness that people have done for me and especially the Irish teens ones, is some of the most interesting ones are ones that are much bigger steps than certain you would expect from someone in that position delivered really unassuming with.",Stranger,,,Help in time of need,,

Tell us a little bit about what you were thinking through in that post and why it might be important for this big incoming technology companies.","[01:13:53]The one that pops in the head, I think I've told this story on another podcast before, was when I first started Stratechery, I had been doing it for a month or two before I reached out broadly because I wanted to have a bit of a catalog there. I'm a big believer that for a publication, the most important story you write is the second story someone clicks on. People can write one good article, but if they go to your site and say, ""Oh, this is a good article,"" and they start clicking around, if the second article they click is also really good, they're like, ""Oh, wow. Maybe there's actually some degree of consistency here where I should be connected to this.""I had this in mind. I didn't want to send my site off to someone with one article on it like, ""Oh, please read my book."" Well, there's one article here. Is this actually worth my time? So anyhow, a few months in, I emailed a guy named John Gruber, who does Daring Fireball, mostly folks on Apple, and someone I had respected a lot. He had been independent since the mid-2000s and I always looked at as that's what I want to do. I want to be an independent writer on the internet. It'd be great.I reached out to him and said, ""Hey, I read a new site. You should check it out."" Listed a few articles. Didn't hear anything back. Maybe a month later, I got an email from him pointing out how I misused a word. He gave me the etymology of the word, ""Oh, I used to make the same mistake. I actually made a shortcut so it would auto correct itself."" Et cetera, et cetera. And, that was the end of the email.But, people who know who John Gruber is, this is a very unsurprising email to get from him but I figured, ""Oh, he's probably going to link to a piece to it. It's going to be very exciting."" Well, he didn't just link to a piece. He actually wrote a full article. In the beginning, he's like, ""Oh, this is the best new blog I've seen in years. Read this article. Read this article."" Glowing praise. And then at the end, he says, ""But for the first time, I disagree with Thompson."" Then, he spends 1000 words saying why I was wrong about something.That endorsement, at the time I had about 500 Twitter followers just to use as a metric. I went from 500 to 1500 overnight. Since then, I have 140,000 more but it's been just a slow and steady progression. As far as a step change goes, that was by far the biggest and that is really what kick started the site. I've always been deeply appreciative and grateful for that. Funny now, six, seven years on, we actually just started a new podcast ... I do Stratechery, obviously, which you're aware of, four days a week. You can consume it either via email, which is the way it's always been, or via podcast which is a new offering.Me and John are actually doing a new podcast three days a week, 15 minutes per episode, just to explore what does it mean to monetize a podcast, so it's subscription only, which is a new idea. But it's cool that he did this great favor for me and now seven years later, we get to do something as equals. It's very gratifying in that regard.q",Peer,important in field,,Promoted on platform,,
Shishir Mehrotra,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/77569538/mehrotra-the-art-and-science-of-the-bundle?tab=transcript,"My guest today is Shishir Mehrotra and the topic of our conversation is the business bundle. Offering access to multiple products, services, or providers for a single bundled price. This topic is full of incorrect preconceived notions. And as it turns out, the bundle is one of the most powerful ideas in business. Properly harnessed, it is good for everyone involved. Shishir explains the ins and outs of bundles in this conversation. Shishir ran product at YouTube for years and sits on the Spotify Board of Directors. He founded and now leads Coda which is a doc spelled backward, in 2014. To bundle together productivity apps like docs, spreadsheets, databases, and applications. I love this wonky detailed conversation which has me thinking differently about many businesses and business strategy more generally. Please enjoy.","[01:06:29]I'm going to tell a story, is the first one that popped in my mind. A story about one of my favorite coaches. It's Bill Campbell. And Bill, some of your listeners may know him, he was known as the coach. There's a book written about him recently called Trillion Dollar Coach. He was one of my very early coaches when I started my first company Centrata. The primary investors, those close like Kleiner Perkins and Bill was coaching all of the CEOs from that network. And so I got to spend time with Bill well before he was primary mentor to Steve Jobs and Larry Page and so on. And little old me could get some useful advice from Bill. And he was super helpful, he would show up at.And he's one of those coaches and mentors that would help at a moment's notice. And sometimes provide useful advice and sometimes just provide a little nudge. And he would just sort of orient me in the right direction or he'd tell me, you're already on the right track, you should have some confidence, Shishir. That's the right way to do it. And then we had this one conversation, that was really instructive to me. And it really formed how I think about people contributions in life. So we're about a year into this relationship and I go to Bill and I said, hey, I just noticed I was looking through our records, I noticed we never formalized an advisory agreement. You've been advising the company, he's literally showing up every week and is spending a lot of time on it.And I said, we never formalized agreements. You're not getting paid. I'd like to make sure that we do that. I don't want to take advantage of your time. And he said no, Shishir I don't need any of that. Don't worry about it. And I said really? That's a little bit weird. And he says, yeah, look, I've been quite lucky in my career, I've made a lot of money so on. If you really feel strongly about it, write whatever you want, but just donate it straight to charity because that's all it's going to do. And I said okay, that's interesting. I'm 21 years old at the time, the idea of interacting with someone that was willing to put in their time and turn down any compensation wasn't something I was that used to at the time.But then I asked him, I said, okay, well, that's interesting. I feel every other person I talked to, has got something in mind. They're all motivated by something. What is it for you? What's causing you to do this? How are you judging? And he gave me the most useful framework. And he said, look, the way I look at it, is I look at the list of people I've mentored and helped. And I just count how many of them are executives and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies and I look at my old team and I see where did they land. And I just think of that as my personal scoreboard.It was so powerful. And by the way, he passed away a few years back and his funeral was one of the, it was a who's who funeral. Everybody you can important you can think of was there. And every single person got up and gave a speech. Said almost the exact same thing. Some version of the story I just gave. Bill always seem to have time for me, he always seemed to make me feel it was only my problems were important to him. And yet he seemed to have helped everybody else around as well. And I don't know how he possibly did it. But so this is sort of a little bit meta. But his personal time commitment to me was super, one of the most kind things I'd ever seen done for me.But probably the bigger gift was, it just gave me a framework for thinking about helping people that was not so direct and not so transactional and not so, if those people succeed, he felt success in other people's success. That was his bar. That was his way of judging. Did I have impact? And I think if you look at it that way, all of a sudden your payback on helping someone is way more directly correlated. And you don't have to worry about will this ever get repaid and so on. And so I thought that was a really kind gift and I try to pay that forward as much as I can.",Mentor,,,Mentorship,,

I don't know if it's the kindest, but I remember when I was in grad school, I went through sort of, I don't know if you'd call it existential crisis, but I went into economics in grad school just because I loved the subject, which is a good motivation long-term, but the idea of what it meant to be an economist had never even really occurred to me. I wasn't thinking about a career or anything. And then, as I got into it, I sort of had to think about those things. And then I was also doing some early-stage business stuff with my brother. My wife's quip about that period was; today we would've called it a social enterprise, and back then, you just called it a failure.And so it was a hard period for me. And I sort-of had to do, eventually, sort-of had to do a full stop. And I just essentially stopped, I mean, I got through my comprehensive exams for my PhD, just sort of stopped and did other things and really couldn't get any real traction and looking forward with my thesis. And then, after about two or three years of that, I finally got to the point where I said, ""Okay, it's time. If I'm going to do this, I should really do it."" And I had a dear friend and mentor at Yale, a guy by the name of Bill Parker who's one of the most eminent economic historians in the world and an incredibly warm-hearted, caring person, aside from being just brilliant. And I came back to him. I said, ""Bill, I've got to get back to this. I'm going to start over. I'm going to start my thesis from scratch. I'd like you to be the chair of my thesis committee, and we'll just start over."" And he said, ""Fine."" And kind of supported me all the way but actually finishing my thesis, probably the hardest thing I've ever done, even harder than starting a business, and his unwavering support and good humor during that process was just instrumental, and had he not done that, my life would've been different. So it was really important.",Teacher,,,,,

And one particular moment came to my mind when it sort of looked like my entire world was telling me that I'm someone I'm not. And a couple of people in the company got together and just recorded really quick videos about how Shopify changed their life and the fact that it exists and what it meant to them. And it's one of those videos I have on my phone. And I have gone back to it so many times at the right moment, when I just needed something.

We discuss the opportunity in these markets from all angles; demographics, valuations, sectors, and beyond. It's important to note that we recorded this conversation before the COVID pandemic, and these markets have fallen 30% more without a similar rebound in prices that we've seen in the U.S. As you listen, you'll hear why this may be relevant for the companies Manny focuses on and may accentuate the opportunity in frontier markets even relative to the numbers quoted in this conversation.

So I'm a young parent and two little daughters, one on the way, and combining with the travel and all that. And I take parenting very seriously. It's been taxing. So I would argue the first one is my parents that have put me on this earth and then looked after me during times when I was probably not always nice to them. I think that's clearly a big sacrifice. Only, I think parents understand. And secondly, my wife, I guess who said yes when I asked her to marry me. And she's now doing the heavy lift on our kids. And that's again something that I think needs to be mentioned. And then lastly again, I would point to, if I think back on my life, there's been many positive influences and mentors and help. But the fact that I got the scholarship has been, I think pretty life-changing. And I'm sure I would have been fine in Germany, but I would've never have had the opportunities professionally or personally that I have now. So my wife now have given a dozen scholarships to the LSE and starting on a small way to give back ourselves. And Kingsway, the name of the firm's actually after the streets that LSE is on. So I own it up to scholarship, donor, and to the school at large. And so I'm starting in very small ways too. I haven't forgotten about the goal.",Parents,,,Sacrifice,,

I've used her framework for how to think about client engagement, company data, and marketplace liquidity and quality over and over again in my business life. I'm so excited to finally have her on the show. Please enjoy our conversation.
So Sarah, let's start with something that you've been thinking about recently that everyone will understand because they're users of the companies, which is the lessons you've learned from looking at the food delivery companies and just this space generally speaking. Why is this interesting? Why is it so incredibly competitive? Obviously it's a big market. What are the main takeaways that you've learned studying that?","Sarah: [00:57:06] I think anybody who's taken a bet on me, thank you. And it probably, I mean to the person, we actually were talking about this earlier, Jeremy Levine at Bessemer was the first person who really took a bet on me. And I was coming out of college. I was at a strategy consulting firm that was a startup. And then decided thanks to a friend of mine who mentioned venture capital to me. And I read a book about it. I was like, ""That sounds really interesting."" And yet I was this person. I was a philosophy major in college. I had always been interested in investing, but had had no experience in investing. And somehow for some reason, Jeremy took a bet on me and hired me at Bessemer Venture Partners. And not only did he take a bet on me and bring me in, but then he ended up taking a very active role in mentoring me through my six years at Bessemer. So I as an investor know now how precious all your time is. And you're always making these decisions on how do you allocate that marginal hour.

I'm in the music business and I'm an artist and I hate touring and I don't know what I'm going to do next in life, and I learn about Spotify. One really wonderful person in my life was a guy named Shakil Khan, who was one of the early investors in Spotify, and he really believed in me as having the potential to not just be an artist.

And then, I want to go pretty deep into a study you put out not that long ago about investing through periods of crisis and really take it piece-by-piece to share with the audience the lessons that you learned, I think, in a two-year research project.

I read poetry on the side and was the poetry editor of literary magazines, spent a lot of my time writing. And when I was going into my senior year, my main teacher, a woman named, Lucie Brock-Broido was leaving Harvard for Columbia. And she asked me, what did I want to do with poetry the next year? And could she help me? And I said, well, if I could do anything at all with no constraints, I'd love to be a student of a man named William Alford who wrote First Place. And I'd taken his last class, his last lecture class when I was a freshman, had retired a few years before. But if I could send you with William Alford, that would be my ideal. And she called him up and Williams said yes, and invited me to his house in Cambridge once a week. And he would prepare me lunch and make me tea and we would talk about poetry that I was reading, and I would bring in one of my poems and we discussed that. There was a moment when we were reading Elizabeth Bishop and he cried because he missed her.

Chetan Puttagunta is a general partner at Benchmark Capital and has a remarkable track record of investing in early-stage software businesses including several like Mulesoft, MongoDB, and Elastic that went on to be public companies. Chetan has been my key guide for understanding the world of enterprise software as we at O'Shaughnessy Asset Management have built an investment platform called Canvas. His advice has been critical to our early success in software. In this episode, we explore the history of software and software investing and go into the details on how to build and grow new software businesses. We discuss product, sales and marketing, recruiting, scaling, and everything in between. Please enjoy this great conversation with one of my favorite business and investing thinkers.","Chetan: [01:17:56] Yeah. Look, I'm incredibly thankful of all of the mentors that I have come across in my career, I've just been super lucky to be with really amazing investors from the very start of my investing career, so really great people like Harry Weller, Robbie, and Jon Sakoda, Ira Mazool who took a really active role in mentoring me, and then folks like Peter Fenton who I got to observe from a very early stage in terms of how to be a great board member and a great business partner and how to be super-prepared and for board meetings and how to think strategically about advising entrepreneurs to my partners today, like Bill, and Eric, and Sarah, who are constantly pushing me and making me a better investor. And I also as you know, we've both done this, which is like learning in public and finding brand-new connections through Twitter that then become sort of informal mentors to you that then sharpen your own ideas about what's next. And so I think that idea of just being forward-leaning and having that learning mentality and being completely open-minded, and you just realize how many great knowledgeable people there are in the world that are just open to being very kind and being informal mentors that I think has continued to really surprise me that I'm super, super thankful for.",Mentor,,,Mentorship,,

Bill Campbell taking the time with me when I was a 24-year-old who had been a journalist and showing interest and being thoughtful not only about what intros he could make but really thinking what would be best for me and the follow through on it I think is as kind as any professionally that I can think about. And really mattered to me. And is a model that I subscribe to. But I think that level of interest in helping others' careers is something that I've been shown a lot and tried to show a lot. The female venture of community has been monumentally meaningful to me. You brought up Sarah.Sarah is a very close friend and an investor I really admire. A total genius. We had babies almost exactly at the same time. And I remember, she was my first call around moving firms and how to navigate that. And also how to deal with lots of things with an infant. And so those kind of relationships, or Jenny Lefcourt, Emily Melton, or Annie Kadavy, all these people that were navigating their own careers and have things that I could learn from. And were able to talk to me not only about quality of a company or the kind of facts and nuts and bolts of investing. But how it would integrate into my life and how to be really thoughtful as both friends and mentors and co-investors has been one of the biggest catalysts, I think, of my venture career.

But in a professional context, I actually go back to the guy that I mentioned, who was our first investor in Entrepreneur First. The reason I say it's the kindest thing is we were so clueless. I mean whatever you're imagining it was worse. We'd been so conditioned to believe it was a bad idea that I think we actually lowered our ambition about what to do. We were trying to raise 250K in 25K increments from just anyone we knew who might have 25K. Matt: [01:12:41] We went to see this guy. He was so kind. He was sort of like, ""Hmm, I don't think this is the best way for you to fundraise. How about..."" He was even kinder than I'm making it. He was like, ""How about you go away, spend a month thinking about what you actually need to build this into the thing you want it to be, come back? We'll have lunch. Let's talk about it.""

""That which you do not bring forth from within you will destroy you. And that which you do bring forth from within you will save you.""And so if you're sleepwalking through life and not even know you're sleepwalking, which is often the case as it was with me, I was a nice guy, I was outwardly, nothing wrong. But I realized I was living inside this frame that was flawed in terms of the relationship with her. And essentially, I blew it up, blew it up big time.

So, I'm going to make a little bit of a long answer on this because I have listened to your podcast, and I've thought about this a lot. I think anyone that's born of immigrant parents, who came here basically to make their kids have a better life, their answer has to be their parents. My dad and mom came here from Taiwan. They were originally from China. When the communists took over, my dad, they never had cable in their lives. If you talk about a great lesson about compounding, my dad was a professor, my mom was a nurse anesthetist. Great jobs, but none of them are what you would consider to be jobs that would set you up for the rest of your life in terms of... but they never had cable. The only money they really ever spent was on our education. Both my sisters and I went to Phillips Exeter Academy and then to MIT. So that's not a cheap amount of money at that level. But yet, when my mom got sick, I turned to my dad and I was like, ""Hey Dad, how are you doing financially? Are you okay?"" He was like, it's many years ago, but he's like, ""I have about $5 million in my retirement account."" I was like, ""What the?"" So I think clearly, my dad and my mom would be my answer. That's the easy answer.The other answer is a guy by the name of Kevin Compton. So Kevin is close with Sam Hinkie. Now, he's the Operating Partner at Kleiner Perkins for the heyday and now runs a company called Radar Partners. I invited him to my wedding. He, at the time, owned the San Jose Sharks and was this tremendously passionate owner about the Sharks. The weekend that we were getting married down in Newport Beach, the Sharks had game 3 against the Detroit Red Wings in Detroit. Rather than going to that game, he came to my wedding. Because the game was Friday night, when he needed to be traveling, instead of flying, he drove from San Jose down to Newport Beach, so he and his wife could listen to the game on the radio, so they wouldn't miss it, but they could still make all the events in time and have it all timed perfectly.That idea of him coming, and he's a guy that's always showing up for everything for me, both from a social and a professional level. It's a guy that has had all the success in the world, as they always say, the classic thing of how you know about someone, how they treat someone that can't really do anything for them.

Please enjoy my conversation with Gavin Baker.
So Gavin, this is going to be really fun. The way that you invest, I think, is one of the last interesting ways to do public market investing. I'd love you to begin by describing what is unique about the way that you view markets - maybe growth, tech, and consumer specifically - and why you do it this way.","Gavin: [01:01:23] I feel I'm a big student of happiness research, and happiness research would say many things but one of them is that the most important emotion, I think in some ways, to feel is gratitude. I feel really grateful to so many people. I feel very grateful to my junior English teacher a woman named Nancy Eisenberg. I sent her a note in 2014 explaining this but I was actually not a good student in high school. I loved to read, I loved to do other things, I was very social, I played video games. But I did not study that hard. Junior year at my high school in Houston, Texas, the big thing was the junior research paper. You had to write an enormous paper that was really going to be the centerpiece of your grade in junior year. Of course, junior English is very important. So I thought, ""Wow, I'd better be super serious about this."" And It had been a six-month process that I thought, ""I'm going to work on this for three days really hardcore."" And that was a lot of work for me at the time.So I turned in the first draft and it comes back, F. And I think, ""Geez, I worked pretty hard on this. I objectively think it was pretty good."" So I went to see Mrs. Eisenberg, and I said, ""Mrs. Eisenberg, this is the worst grade I've ever gotten."" And she said, ""Well, Gavin, I have very high expectations for you. And I know that you can do better than this.""That was perfectly designed to appeal - she was a very good teacher - to a 17-year-old young man, to make him work hard. So I went and I worked hard for the first time in my life. And it was super fulfilling, and I ended up getting an B+ or an A-. She wasn't going to give me an A. But that was an incredibly fulfilling experience for me that I think drove a lot of future outcomes in my life.",Teacher,,,Critique,"similar to the firing one earlier, going to call this critique",

Okay. So kindest thing. It's hard because there are a lot of kind things along the way. But the one that stands out to me is my uncle, when I was, I'll say in fourth grade, so this would have been, I think, '94. I was getting into computers and I had this curiosity, and he ran this computer business, and he could tell I was excited about it. And I had learned some QBasic programming. Remember that Mike, QBasic?

Mike: [01:30:30] Yeah.

Kevin: [01:30:30] I was playing around with it and showed him that I was excited. We had one computer in the house and my dad was doing it for work. My mom needed it. The family shared it. And one time, I don't remember exactly when, he came to our house and he pulled out a laptop and I still remember it because the screen was green and black.

It wasn't black and white, it was black and green. He said, “Here, you can have this.” And I don't even remember if it just ran DOS or something. It basically let me start programming. And I had it in my room and I remember the table it sat on, and I would use it every single night for hours on end, instead of doing my homework and for him to take what probably was really expensive at the time. I mean, laptops were not cheap. And just say here, kid, take this thing, program your heart out. That was definitely the kindest thing anyone's ever done for me.",Uncle,,Family,Gift,gave a computer,

So my now wife, then girlfriend, for Valentine's day in 2011, I want to say, really wanted to do something different and special. And we've been dating for two or three years at the time. And she decided she was going to learn to code and build a thing called Lovestagram, which was around for a few years. Where basically you put your name and your Valentine's name in, and it would go through both of your Instagrams and find photos of you together basically create like a digital postcard of that stuff. And it was awesome. One, it's just a very thoughtful, cool thing to do, because we were deep in Instagram at the time, literally the most important thing in the world at that time, other than my relationship with her. But two, it was fun.

It was like the learning that she went through for that. And she kept it a secret until the night before the day. And then she was like, “Hey, I need to tell you this. Because I'm going to launch this tomorrow and I'm worried it's going to fall over.” And I basically spent the next four hours adding Memcached and making stuff asynchronous. And I was like, that's my way of expressing love back, is I'm going to optimize your gift now. But just the thoughtfulness, and the fact that learning has obviously been the theme of our conversation, but the fact that that was the thing that she chose to do. And she had almost basically no programming experience before that, to go from that to a fully functioning Django app with use of the Instagram API and web design was incredible.",Wife,,Family,Gift,"Wife created lovestagram, wonderful gift",

He is committed to evolution, innovation, and growth for both himself and for Spotify, and is on my shortlist of CEOs to emulate. This was one of my favorite conversations on the podcast. I hope you enjoy it.
So, Daniel, so when we were walking around the Westside highway, a couple of months ago, I kept pulling my phone to take notes for topics because I knew we would be doing this one day.

I think the kindest thing that anyone ever did for me is probably one of the toughest things and the kindest things at the same time. So, growing up, I actually come from a music family and my grandfather was an opera singer. And for him, one of the biggest things was that I learn music properly. And I'll like when many people may think I actually wasn't that motivated in doing it. And he was the old school of classically trained, you needed to do that, you needed to read, do all that stuff. And it was incredibly tedious. I spent hours and hours per day doing it. And I had to struggle for a few years, really, really struggled. And I hated it. I didn't enjoy it at all.And then for some reason, I just passed a bump where I got over that initial hardship of learning that thing. And I started enjoying it. And then as I got into my teens, I got into rock music and really played in bands. And I started enjoying it for real, in a massive way. And for me, music has been that left brain, right brain thing. And it's a lot more almost mathematical than most people realize, it's got more formulas and more patterns than most people ... It's taught me a ton.But the most important lesson I think he taught me is that don't be afraid of the struggle. It would've been so easy for him to kind of give in and settle, ""Well, he clearly doesn't enjoy this,"" but I've learned so much now about putting myself in situations where I don't know anything at all and just endure it for a period of time, because I know that I'll come to that hump where I'm going to start enjoying it. I don't know how long it will take, and it's going to be very uncomfortable in meantime, but he taught me that, and that was super valuable.",Grandfather,,Family,Teaching,,

A bit of an introduction to what they do may be helpful here for some extra context. Stedi is a platform for exchanging and automating 300 types of business-to-business transactions, things like purchase orders and invoices. It's a modern take on an archaic protocol called EDI, Electronic Data Interchange, something I'd never even heard of until a few months ago.
Learning about EDI is a bit like finding out about the matrix. Every physical object you come across, from the food you ate for breakfast to the clothes you're wearing and the electronics you use, basically anything with a barcode on it was likely touched by EDI, often dozens of times before making it into your hands. Stedi is the first update to this messaging layer in decades. Our conversation in this podcast is about business in general, starting with Zack's fascination with Walmart and Amazon. I should also note that my family is a recent investor in Stedi, and I'm thankful to have learned a great deal from Zack over the last few months, please enjoy our conversation.","Zack: [01:18:10] I have one that's top of mind based on the conversations that we've had tonight, which is when I was starting Stedi, I didn't know anything about start-ups.

And I said, “There's this one guy on Twitter who likes my tweets a lot and I'm pretty sure he's a VC.” And so I look him up, his name's Zach Ware at the time he's at a fund called VTF Capital. I sent him to like a two-page DM, which is like something we didn't get to talk about as this idea of all the common advice in terms they say, “Don't write long emails.” Well, it depends on how good of a writer you are. Sometimes if you feel like writing is an edge you have, maybe you should write long emails.I wrote this long thing. I'm not even sure at this point how coherent it was. And he said, “Let's talk.” And his background is at Zappos. He sort of knew the EDI terminology and everything and totally got it. And I didn't have a deck, I didn't have a name. I didn't have a website and he said, “I'll commit for a 100K.” First call, that opened up unbelievable doors. They eventually went on to invest more than that. Unbelievable doors and if I could cheat by offering a second one, which is the second thing that sort of, I forget who was telling me about this. It might have been Brett from First Round, with this idea of kindling. The beginning of a relationship, the beginning of a business is very delicate. And it's like, you ever see a Castaway Oysters, my agency's just trying to blow on that fire and get it to work.I think people don't realize how fragile these things are because the most little time they fall apart before they even happen, it's like the Fermi paradox. And so I got this first commitment from Zach who believed in me and has believed in me more than anybody, more than anybody had in my entire life. He just the conviction, boom, “I believe in you.” And then the second one was Ryan Petersen from Flexport by happenstance of too long of a story to tell here, I ended up with some early adviser shares in Flexport. I was an early Flexport customer. And Flexport is gone on to just raise a billion dollar round from SoftBank. And I told Ryan, “Hey, I'm doing this EDI thing just figured I tell you about it.” And he said, “I'm pretty broke right now, but I at least I can do 10K.” And this is not those three years ago or something like that. And I said, “okay, it's amazing.”He texts me. And he says, “Here's a link to my Crunchbase page. Just tell me anyone else you want an intro to.” And that was, I mean, just like what an unbelievable thing of saying, like, “I'm going to open up my whole cap table to anyone you want an intro to.” And response to that kindness. I said, “Here's a list of all of them. Please send me an intro.” So, those are the two things. You look at these things, the trajectories of life and Stedi has been the most meaningful thing I've ever done and I'm only two and a half years in because it's changed my whole network health in terms of the people I've met, quality of thoughts that I'm having because I'm being pushed to such a limit of what I'm able to do. I can all trace back to those two people who said, “I believe in you let's do this,” and opened up their networks to me.",Investment firm,,,Took a chance,first check,
Chris Bloomstran,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/67727084/bloomstran-what-makes-a-quality-company?tab=transcript,"My guest this week is Chris Bloomstran, the president and chief investment officer of Semper Augustus Investments Group. He became famous in investing circles a few years ago for his incredibly detailed investigations of Berkshire Hathaway. But we do cover Berkshire towards the end of the conversation we spend most of our time talking about what makes for a quality business. I love some of his angles in the current landscape, including our discussion of companies like Richemont and Disney, which are actively taking distribution back in-house. Please enjoy our conversation.
An interesting place to start, which I've really not done before, would be with your biggest mistake, biggest investing mistake. We'll talk a lot about successes and interesting companies over the course of the conversation, but oftentimes we learn most from our biggest screw-ups. And you were talking a little bit about one of those before we hit record. And so let's begin there.","Chris: [01:11:48] I'm only getting into podcasts now. And so obviously prepping for this Joe even called me and said, I'll bring you to the podcast, better dig into this question. And so, you know, outside of you inviting me to the podcast, of course, and parents would think, which I think everybody kind of acknowledges, I have thought about this and I would say, so I played football for a long time from eight years old up through college. And I had a series of men kind of molded me to be driven with work ethic. My father was very hard on me, very tough. And for that, I think that was one of the kindest of things he could do as well. He was an old Marine and one summer I'd move a pile of river rock out of the driveway. One summer, I, by hand with a pickaxe and the shovel, dug the foundation for an addition to the house. We didn't get a backhoe. I was the backhoe that summer. On a corner lot. We did a brick fence and we had to be 24 inches deep and 12 inches square. By the time he got home from work every day. So I spent a whole summer with summers in a row with pickaxe and a shovel loading up the pickup truck.But it was these football guys. I'm kind of going backward. Really learned the benefits. Yeah. Out-working everybody, and kind of working backward with bill McCartney and at college and Brian McGregor and high school. See if I can remember all these guys I'm Joe Studenka, John Walker, Bob Jordan. But my first coach, gentlemen named Ken Aker, had me when I was eight years old and nine years old. He was a terrific man. He didn't have kids that had played. I think about it now. He was probably my age and I thought he was a fossil. I was eight and he was an old, old guy with grey hair. And now I'm an old, old guy with gray hair and I've been coaching football for the last six, seven years, eight years. So I'm sure these kids look at me through a similar lens and he took us at eight and sat us down in his living room the whole team go to the 20 of us, I think, asked who at that time knew. But in-between offense and defense, I'll never forget. Nobody knew because we didn't have Madden and we were eight. We hadn't played football. You weren't watching a lot of football on TV. And so he explained all that. And so he was just a great mentor and a teacher, and I'll never forget, it was a terrible football player at the age of eight.I improved on that. I was more interested in watching planes fly overhead during games. And when I kind of figured it out as an offensive lineman that year, it was easier to go try to block the safety than it was the big kid standing in front of me. Well, that's not exactly how football is supposed to work. By the time I got to nine, for whatever reason, I was a lot more highly motivated and I was very driven by the game and I was inspired by this man because he was fair. He was hard on us, but he was fair. And I was so desperate to get back under his tutelage. This is between eight and nine, right. I'm still a kid. So we work hard. We had a good football team and I'll never forget. We lost a game to Columbine. This is in Colorado, Jefferson County and we lost this game. And I was crushed. So we had our team meeting at the end. All the parents are standing around. The kids are standing around and I was just crying. I was bawling my eyes out, but I'll never forget. He came over in the middle of the meeting. He put his arm around me and he said some of the kindest things that anybody could have ever said.He talked about my evolution from the prior year and the work ethic and that moment really inspired me to just be the best football player I could. And for the rest of my years playing the game, nobody outworked me in the weight room, nobody ran more sprints. I did everything I could to be a great player and I attributed it to him.And so we had my 30th, high school reunion a couple of years ago. And somebody on social media put a picture of our nine-year-old football team out. And I hadn't thought about some of these guys in years. A lot of them didn't wind up going to the high school. A lot of them did. There were some very good football players on that team, but I thought about coach Aker for the first time in a long time. And I thought, well, geez, you know, I've gotten to be really great friends with my high school coach, Brian McGregor. He and I are very close. I thought I should go try to find coach Aker. And I hadn't thought about how old he was when he coached me, but he had passed away. I learned by digging up and I spent a week trying to find him.But I found his kids. I found his three sons, gosh, even his two assistant coaches had passed away. But I found his kids who ultimately, after those years in the late 1970s also got into coaching with him. And I sent him a note about what he meant to me and. I wouldn't be who I am today without the nice things he said to me during the game, but what he had done for me for the two years and they interned, so his wife was still away and they then passed along my note to her and they sent me a really nice note back about how it made kind of her decade post having lost him.Patrick:[01:16:18] And, yeah, fantastic. Well, the amount of these answers, they keep morphing and changing and some of my favorites are around mentorship and shaping younger people. When they're kind of most malleable and that's one of my all-time favorite answers. So thanks so much for that. And just the awesome conversation.Chris: [01:16:23] Well, Patrick, thanks. This is awesome. I love the podcast and it's been a lot of fun to get, you know, here in the last few years.Created by @ekmokaya",Father,,Family,Work ethic,,

I hope you enjoy our conversation.","Brian: [00:57:41] The kindest thing that anyone has ever done for me. I want to offer some very concrete thing but I would have to think pretty seriously about that. What comes to my mind, is just the idea of being loved unconditionally by my parents. I think most of the difficult things that I've faced in my life in one form or other took the form of not being totally comfortable with who I was. Whether it was in school, feeling self-conscious about being a nerd, and not answering a question in class, even though I knew the answer because I sort of wanted to fit in or didn't want to seem like I was enthusiastic about school because it wasn't cool to act like that. Throughout my life, I think some of the most meaningful things to me have been ways that I've come to just accept who I am. And so I think one of the kindest things that you can do for someone is to see them exactly as they are and accept them and to be able to do that for oneself is tremendously powerful.",Parents,,Family,Unconditional love,,

The kindest thing anyone has ever done for me. I mean, people are so kind. The thing that leaps to mind is such a simple thing. I was in Paris. I was in my early twenties, and I was sobbing hysterically over something stupid. Like, romance stuff. And I was just on a bench in Paris. I didn't know ... It was my first time I'd been there. I didn't know where anything was. Had to get to a train station. And somebody just walked over to me and asked if I was okay. And I said, ""Yes,"" and she said, ""Are you sure?"" And I said, ""Yes."" And she just sat down next to me. And she didn't try to talk to me, she didn't make me explain anything, but she just sat there. And I felt so safe and welcome by that city, in a way that, I mean, it could've happened on any street corner anywhere, but I'm so grateful to somebody seeing me in pain and wanting to know if I was okay. So I've always kind of make it a practice, if I see somebody in distress, to try to do that. It's one of the small things that, I don't know why that means, I mean, people have done much bigger things for me, but that touched me.",Stranger,,,Help in time of need,asked if she was ok and sat next to her while crying,
Bill Gurley,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/12224182/gurley-all-things-business-and-investing?tab=transcript,"My guest this week is Bill Gurley, a general partner at Benchmark Capital and one of my favorite investment thinkers. As you'll hear, despite enormous success through his career, Bill is clearly still in love with business and investing. Where many might discuss past glories, I've been incredibly impressed with how much Bill and his partners emphasize the current portfolio and market landscape. I'm thankful to have had the chance to speak with him in this format. I hope you enjoy our conversation.
So Bill, and as I just said, I'm totally ashamed that until this morning I had never heard the name Brian Arthur and never read his 1996 piece on increasing returns in business. And so I thought since it's fresh on my mind and I know it was influential for you that we'd start there with this idea of increasing returns, which really at the time flew in the face of much of economics, which was based on diminishing returns. Maybe you could talk about how you stumbled across this and the influence that it's had on your thinking.","Bill: [01:06:04] I mean, I had so many I probably mentioned three or four things. A guy named Al Jackson was head of research at Credit Suisse. I mean, he gave a kid from Texas the chance to come be a sell-side analyst and not like an assistant. I was covering Compaq, whatever, 24 months after I left Compaq as an engineer. He didn't have to do that, I was the only kid from anywhere near Texas in that starting class, all the stuff Mauboussin did, that move that Quattrone did and Winblad and John Hummer giving me my first chance as a venture capitalist, all those things are just super, super, super impactful to your career. And I go back to the, I don't know if Bobby Knight said it first, but we're luckiest where preparation meets opportunity.

Jesse Livermore,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/31424450/livermore-the-search-for-the-truth-with-the-anonymous-master?tab=transcript,"This week, I have a very special guest years in the making. Like another favorite episode with anonymous guest, Modest Proposal. This conversation is with one of the stars of the financial Twitter universe who writes anonymously and goes by the pseudonym Jesse Livermore. I met Jesse six years ago after reading his unbelievable unique investor research, which tackled all the big and interesting issues in markets. He now also works with me as a research partner at OSAM, where he's used our data to continue his search for truth in markets. Despite being one of the brightest minds I've encountered, he's also as humble and unassuming as they come. I'm at least a slightly better person because of trying to emulate how he conducts himself. I get to have many conversations with him that go from zero to 100 fast, and I'm thrilled to be able to share one of those with you.
So Jesse, this is a long time coming. People are going to be excited for this one. My favorite of these conversations are often with people that are anonymous on Twitter, and you've got an interesting reason for being anonymous. We won't go into it, obviously. I'll start by saying you're not in the field of investing professionally and yet many consider you, to me, I certainly do, maybe one of the most thoughtful investing thinkers out there. So tell us your sort of investing origin story. How did you get interested in this topic given that it's not what you do professionally and what has fostered that interest and that love?","Jesse: [01:33:42] Yeah. So obviously, I'd be a fool not to come prepared for this one. So obviously I do want to caveat first, this is not an allowed answer, but I have to have to put my parents in there. They're just amazing parents. My mom and dad have basically been helpful at every stage of my life in terms of providing me whatever I needed, whether it was supporting me through grad school, through whatever else, just unbelievably good parents. Obviously, you're not allowed to use that answer because obviously that's everybody's answer, but this is, I guess interesting. And I thought about this. It's tough to answer because, I don't want to be cynical, but most of the time when people do things for you, they're doing them not because they, I want to say because they want something, but because they-Jesse: [01:34:20] Yeah, there's a self-interest component to it and it's hard to really sit to pretend like that's not there, right? It may be because they just like you and they like your friendship, but there's something that they like that they're getting for them. So I'll give you, I thought about this, and the example that I think is the best example. This isn't out of a storybook situation, but it's actually a pretty kind thing. So several years ago, I was basically looking to get a surgery for an injury and I was really stressed out about it, and I didn't know if it was the right move to make. And so what I did was, I was on this website called pubmed.com, which has like all the journal articles. So I went on there and I basically looked at... I was researching the injury, to see, ""Okay, what's the best way to get surgery for this"" 

And so this guy's name kept coming up, I'm not going to say who it was because he would get in trouble if I kept going. But I found the name of this guy who was like the top chief medical expert on this and the entire country, MD just the top pedal you could imagine, and he had had massive research. So I'm like, ""What's the risk?"" I found his email address, I sent an email to him, I sent him all of my, my information, right? X-ray stuff like that. And I tried to frame it in a way that hopefully, maybe he might just say something about what he thinks. And this guy, he comes back to me at night, apparently he was in bed or something like that 

He's on his iPad, it says, ""Sent from my iPad"". He sends me back this three-page write up of just, ""Hey, here's what you should do. Here's what I would try first. Here's some advice. Here's what I found in this study, that study. Here's... I'm like, ""Whoa, man. You don't even know who I am and you're taking on the risk."" Because it's not fully kosher to be doing that, to be talking to patients that you've never seen before and giving medical advice like that. He gave me everything and he actually helped me make a really good decision in that area by just basically providing me with free medical service, free medical care for nothing and in a way that actually was not only not a net positive, possibly a net negative. Because he's actually now taking a small amount of risk that, what if I don't like what happens and then I sue him, right?

I mean, that's something that I would be thinking about if I was a doctor. Like, ""Hell no, I'm not going to work for free and just give you an information"" out of the goodness of his heart. And it was really like, ""Wow, you are an awesome person."" And I would say further that, I think a lot of the best people in our society really are the people that work in medicine. If you think about surgeons, you think about doctors, they just... I don't know what it is, but my experiences with them have been very positive.",Doctor,,,Mentorship,,

Please enjoy our conversation.
So Jerry, for round two we will cover a whole lot of new things, even since we last talked a year and a half ago or whenever it was, a lot's changed in the world and the proliferation of venture capital as an interesting topic and just the number of people doing it has continued to grow. So I thought it would be fun to start there. You mentioned when you started doing this there was maybe 100, you literally counted, venture investors deploying money into markets, and now there's probably north of 1000. And this has a variety of implications for investors in these types of strategies and for the GPs themselves. So I'd love to walk through sort of your take on today's venture landscape, and the types of investments that VCs are making versus maybe the ones you're making and you think early stage investors should make.",Question not found,,,,,,

I've been interested in the topic of community and gathering for some time. And along with the book, The Art of Community, Priya's book on The Art of Gathering is by far the best I've read. There's both conceptually interesting and extremely practical. In the book there was literally a table for how big a gathering space should be per person sorted by the type of vibe that you're after. We had a time constraint, but I could've talked to Priya for much longer. I hope you enjoy our conversation as much as I did, and that it inspires you to do something new and different with friends, family, or colleagues.
So Priya this is a completely new topic for me, which is always these conversations that I enjoy most. We're going to talk about your book and the framework you lay out in it, but kind of go all over the place as well. I didn't know your background actually, prior to you sitting down. So Art of Gathering is the outgrowth of your professional career. Maybe it'd be interesting to start there with telling people what you do and why that lets you learn about this way of structuring people getting together.","Priya: [00:52:52] It's a lovely question. And I'm having a number of different things come up so I'll go with one that I haven't thought of in a while. It was a very simple moment. I mentioned the top of this conversation that I'm biracial and I'm also bicultural and bi-religious. And I grew up in these two households that believe radically different things, and many of their beliefs were in tension with one another. And one side is evangelical Christian. Then the other side was kind of Hindu, Buddhist, theosophist agnostic. And it was a real source of tension. And I felt at the center of that tension.I went to this summer camp, it was a Christian summer camp when I was... My parents had joint custody. So it was during my father's time of the year. And it was a canoe camp in West Virginia. And I had complicated relationship to the kind of exclusive elements of Christianity. And at one moment, camp counselor, who I loved, and always just seemed to have different interpretations of everything, including the Bible and Christianity, but was one of the strongest leaders in the camp and considered himself a very strong Christian. I saw this like a little image of a tattoo kind of poke out of his sleeve. And I could just see a little bit of it, but it's like really brightly colored. And I thought, that's interesting. I thought this was a Christian camp.And I asked him and I said, ""What is your tattoo of?"" And he looked at me and I could see that he hesitated. And then he looked at me and he just moved to the side and it was a tattoo of Shiva, a Hindu God. And I was shocked and also felt this deep peace. And I looked at him and he looked at me and he winked and he said something, ""Don't worry, it's all there."" And I just thought that for me, I spoke about a lot of my own challenges in these various Bible studies, so he knew where I was coming from. And to me that was a moment of deep kindness because he took a lot of risks. I think tattoos are probably against the code. There was probably a lot of people on the board that would be against those beliefs, but he saw a child that was confused and he, to me offered a moment of kindness that helped me.",Camp counselor,,,Vulnurable ,"church counselor showed that she had a tattoo, was vulnerable to child",

Prior to her current role, she spent the majority of her career in the investment banking and M&A divisions at Goldman. We discuss lessons learned from her career in M&A and the many initiatives she now leads at the firm. I really enjoyed her perspective on how a big, established firm like Goldman can balance innovation with improving existing businesses. Please enjoy our conversation.
You mentioned this idea of synergies. I'm very interested in the M&A side to know the pure and impure motives from both sides, acquirer and acquiree for doing these sorts of deals. So there's some literature that suggests that the average M&A deal is not good for the acquiring company? I'm curious to hear your thoughts on that, having been on the inside. That's a very like quant take, not a company by company take. So what do you think the right reasons are where the most value is created for a big, let's say, merger or acquisition? And then the second question will be, what are the wrong ways to do this?","Stephanie: [00:52:10] That is a super tough question because I feel really blessed. People have been very kind to me. I'm going to talk about my mom for a minute. So I was a competitive figure skater growing up. And of course, you only realized as much later, you don't realize this when you're eight years old. But me skating was a real sacrifice for my family in many ways. So I went at 5:45 in the morning, I got taken out of school, I went in the afternoon, and my mom did all that, and my dad too, without really ever saying anything, without talking to me about what she was giving out from a career perspective, from a monetary perspective. And then the other thing it was hard being a skater, standing in front of the judges, with the audience, all that is actually taxing on a young person, but they were super supportive of that and everything, all the drama and everything else that goes around it. And I think it's the most important thing I did. I think it's turned me into who I am today. So I'll always be grateful for that.",Mother,,Family,Sacrifice,,

This is challenging ground for me as a quant because the data available is so new and limited, so Katherine's perspective was very helpful as we continue to learn. Given the importance of this topic, I'm also searching for guests with both positive and negative views on the role of ESG in the investing framework and welcome suggestions for future guests. Please enjoy my conversation with Katherine Collins.
So we'll spend a lot of time on your current investment process thinking, ESG, which is a topic that's become, I think, really important and interesting. Before we do that, I want to have this debate about mechanical versus human judgment processes. You already mentioned it earlier when you said, everyone's asking about tracking you in sectors and not about, what are you actually doing here? Maybe sum up your view on this, I think what you would characterize as an over mechanization of investing.","Katherine: [00:57:00] All right. I have a strategic one and a tactical one. I was so lucky to be born into my own family, so my parents gave me these two routes. We'd go to church every day when I was little, and so there was this route of kind of spirit that was very deeply set and then we'd go outside all the time. Every weekend, we were down at the Creek, we'd go see the hogs migrate. It was just a normal part of life and it's only later in life I'm realizing how important those two roots are for me and that a lot of folks don't have either at this point. So in my case, those have been the roots that have seen me through the toughest times. Then on the tactical side, we're both also great readers and I do think of books as actual, living friends sometimes, like a little bit over the top.

A friend of mine when I was moving and starting my job at Putnam and had a bunch of other changes in life made me the most amazing gift. It's a big jar and in the jar are quotes from all my favorite books in the world so that every day I can open up a quote and start the day with a friend.",Parents,,Family,Upbringing,,
Geoffrey Batt,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/14711328/batt-the-nature-of-transformational-returns?tab=transcript,"My guest this week is Geoffrey Batt and the topic of our conversation is how to earn transformational returns in very hard markets. In his case, that means Iraqi equities, which we cover in detail. He now runs a large pool of capital in Iraqi Stocks through his firm, Euphrates, but the journey was arduous to say the least. This is one of my favorite boots on the ground contrarian investment stories thus far in the podcast. I hope you enjoy the story and the lessons that Geoff has to offer.
So, Geoff, this is going to be certainly one of the more unique equity investing discussions that I've ever had, centered on investing in Iraq specifically. But before we spend a lot of our hour together on that topic, I want to frame this with the notion that we talked about on the phone. I think we'll call this episode the nature of transformational returns. In several places, you've talked a bit about what it takes to earn the kind of 25, 50X returns that massively change an investor's life. And however wants that, but the actual experience of getting it is massively hard and uncomfortable. So maybe you could frame our entire conversation with this simple idea of what it takes to earn transformational returns.",Geoffrey: [00:53:19] I played basketball in high school and it turns out that I'm the same age as Kobe Bryant and his high school was like a mile away from mine. So we were in the same league and we played a lot. My school played as well. We were on the same court as his team. And I'm sure it wasn't very competitive. People knew back then that he was going to be-,Peer,important in field,,Words of encouragement,Kobe bryant,
Brian Singerman,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/34530101/singerman-investing-in-the-best-founders?tab=transcript,"My guest this week is Brian Singerman, a partner at the venture capital firm, Founders Fund. Founders Fund is widely considered one of the top VC firms, and its partners are known to have diverse investment strategies. Brian invests across industries and focuses on backing exceptional founders. You'll hear right off the bat that he cares about moat, market, and strong execution. I love his point that the only way to become a good investor is to do a lot of investing. He describes himself as an investor who uses his gut a lot, which took me a while to get used to in our conversation. But I have to say that at the end of this episode, I felt refreshed and generally excited to keep putting in reps in my own way, both in the podcast and in quant research settings. I hope you enjoy our conversation.","Brian: [00:39:35] ... my grandmother loving me so much. My parents as well, but my grandmother recently passed and she was always just so nice and loving to me. So I think it's one of those things where you can't put a price on having a loving family between my parents and my grandparents. I was just so lucky with having that family base, and it's tough to put a price on it. And then you see when somebody doesn't have that and you're like, oh man, I wish I could level the playing field in that regard, but that is really difficult to do. So I don't know how something could be kinder than that from a personal relationship perspective if that makes sense.

From a business, the kindest thing. I don't know. There's not a lot of kindness in business. I do appreciate, just like any founder who remembers who their first investor is. Actually, let me give a little bit of a long-winded answer but it's important. Founders Fund 6, which is what we're currently investing out of, is a $1.4-something billion fund. So people are always asking, well, why is it important to do half a million-dollar investments out of that? And I always say it is critical for us to be still doing seed investments out of this fund, and the reason it is critical is first of all, they can have outside returns. It's fine. But also, founders know who their first money was, period. It's something that founders will always remember, who their first money was. They will tell all their friends like, ""Hey. These guys were my first money."" There's a special place in a founder's heart for their first money. Therefore, it is critical that we be first money and do seed investing not just for because we're nice or whatever, but for the future of our business, it is critical that we do that. So similarly, founders remember that, I always remember who took chances on me. And so from a business perspective, again, I come back to I met Sean just by talking about ... I was thinking about maybe I'll do VP of engineering at one of his companies. And he was like, ""Oh, no. You need to come here now,"" and was so sure of that and just pushed that through so quickly that from a business perspective, that was pretty awesome, and so I'll always remember that.",Grandmother,,Family,Love,,
Michael Mauboussin,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/13228134/mauboussin-the-four-sources-of-alpha?tab=transcript,"My guest this week for the third time is Michael Mauboussin. If there's a major question about markets and investing, Michael has usually written one of the best pieces of research on that topic. Today's conversation is a mix of several of his research pieces, but focuses on the sources of alpha. The framing of the conversation is the brilliant question, who is on the other side of a given trade. If you're buying, who is selling, and why? Knowing the answer to this question is one of the keys to understanding where excess return comes from. As is usual with Michael, we explore tons of other interesting ideas that will serve as food for thought. Please enjoy.
Michael, maybe a fun place to start this time, because we were talking about it before we hit record, is for you not to go into each vertical, but give the rough syllabus for the class that you teach, because these chunks, I think, represent a great way for people to think about building out their own market education. And then we're going to spend a lot of time talking about the sources of alpha today and valuation measures. But as framing, I think that the outline of the course would actually be a great place to start.",Question not found,,,,,,
Annie Duke,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/34891968/duke-wanna-bet?tab=transcript,"My guest this week is Annie Duke, and the topic of our discussion is how to improve decision-making. We break decisions down into their component parts, values, beliefs, decisions, randomness and outcomes. After diving into each, we discuss how to make better decisions, how to work in group settings and how to harness the power of tribes and identity to improve our behavior. Annie has thought about this topic as much as anyone and her methods for getting us to think in probabilities, and to stop evaluating decisions based on outcomes tainted by randomness will be useful for anyone listening. Please enjoy.","Annie: [01:04:28] I've had so much kindness in my life. I think if I have to pick like a isolated moment that doesn't have to do with the usual stuff... I'm trying to give you something other than the usual stuff because my husband is the kindest person. He is so kind to me that I'd have to write a book about the kind of.... He wins like all the kindest things. But I feel like that sort of in the normal category, so I'm going to give you something that's outside the norm, a very kind thing that somebody did for me that really had an impact. When I went to graduate school, I had an amazing advisor, Lila Gleitman, and I also worked with her husband, Henry Gleitman, but Henry's passed. And Lila was an incredibly important person in my life. She's brilliant and funny and incredible, and she was really like a mother to me. She wasn't just like my thesis advisor, she was really amazing.At the end of graduate school, as I was going out for my job talks, during the last year I've been struggling with this very bad stomach problem which we had discussed before and I was really sick. And I was going out for my first job talk at NYU and it just got to the point where I was so sick I just couldn't keep food down and I ended up in the hospital for two weeks, I had something called gastroparesis. So I was literally on an IV, it was pretty bad, I was really sick. So in academics, the job market is seasonal and so I had to cancel all of my job talks and then obviously I needed time to recover, it was a very bad time in my life. I felt like this was all very unlucky, which is a good lesson in itself because I think it was actually quite lucky that my life took that turn.So now I take time off from school and it's during that time that I start playing poker. So the thing about graduate school is that it's like five years of your life that you're putting this time in and I felt very keenly that this was time that these people had put into me and like a tremendous amount of effort that these people have put into me. And as I was kind of going through this physical crisis and I start playing poker, I think that I sort of felt this need to like escape from the world a little bit. And at that time poker was not on television, it wasn't until about eight years into when I was playing poker that it became on TV. So it was a very good vehicle for hiding from the world a little bit because I physically didn't feel well, and so I think that's kind of what I wanted to do.So part of that was that I sort of hid from them. I had some contact with them over the years, but not too much. And I have a probably overdeveloped feeling of shame in disappointing people, and so I really felt that, and then that caused a problem with me sort of continuing to interact with them. I carried through my whole life as I was having this flourishing poker career, and then about eight years into I was playing poker I actually started doing the academic work again through merging the two. In 2002 is when I started doing the work that you see in Thinking In Bets. I just always felt like I had really disappointed these people, and in particular, that I very much disappointed Lila, like really disappointed her. And I was very ashamed of it, I imagined that she was quite ashamed of me, and this was all kind of like this narrative that was living in my head.So we lose touch, really my fault, completely my fault because I think that I just carried around this sense of having failed so strongly that my fault I hide from her. So now this amazing thing happened. In 2012, I tore my bicep tendon. At this point, I've retired from poker, I've moved back to Philadelphia. And I'm in an orthopedist office and I look over and there's Lila. This is the kindest thing that's ever happened to me because I walk over and I sit down and I say, ""Hi, Lila, it's Annie."" And I think I use my maiden name, I think I said, ""It's Annie Lederer."" And it was just this awe and smile and ""Oh my God,"" and hug and sitting and talking. And then she just said, ""I'm so proud of you."" And we exchanged information and we have had lunch basically every three weeks ever since. And it's like I have this mom back.But it was that moment. She never said to me, why did you leave? Why did you stop contacting me? Why did you lose touch? She could have foisted so much on me about my not having maintained that relationship, and there was none of it. It was just, ""I'm so proud of you."" And that is absolutely the kindest thing that anybody has ever done for me.",Mentor,,,Encouragement,this mentor was her phd advisor,
Michael Mayer,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/20237359/mayer-pseudonymous-social-capital-and-bottomless-coffee?tab=transcript,"My guest this week is unique, and so requires a short story. I met our guest, Michael Mayer, because of Twitter. I followed and enjoyed one of several pseudonymous accounts that he maintains to experiment with ideas. His various accounts have wide followings. I think many of the best accounts on Twitter are anonymous or pseudonymous. And I've always made a point to get to know the ones that I like best.
As it turns out, Michael was also an entrepreneur. He'd been building a new company and was raising a small amount of outside capital. I didn't personally invest, in part, because he raised it so quickly after I spoke with him. Ever since I've gotten to know him better, I've followed his company Bottomless with interest. You know that I'm always hyper-transparent about any potential conflicts of interest so it's worth noting that while I'm not an investor in his company, I expect to be at some point in the future.","Michael: [01:06:02] Yeah. So, I spoke earlier about the importance of having people who genuinely want you to thrive. I didn't have a lot of people like that in my life up until I met my wife. I didn't actually know that was a thing. When she came into my life, I suddenly had this incentive because somebody else wanted me to do well. I think wanting somebody else to do well, regardless of how that reflects on you, is fundamentally kind. There's a lot of people in my life that have helped me. Obviously, I'm very appreciative of that. But there's very few truly selfless acts. A lot of people help you because it helps them. But truly, wanting somebody to thrive and do better is very selfless and is something that I'm truly thankful to have in my life.",Wife,,,Selflessness,,

Peter is a geopolitical strategist who combines expertise in demography, economics, energy, politics, technology, and security to assess an uncertain future. Before founding his own strategy firm, Peter helped develop the analytical models for Stratfor, one of the world's premier private intelligence companies. I came across Peter via his great books, The Accidental Superpower and The Absent Superpower. We discuss America's changing place in the world and four additional countries poised to do well in the future. Spoiler alert, he believes the US is particularly well-positioned. While we don't discuss equity markets, per se, all of what we talk about will obviously impact companies across the world for the remainder of our careers. Please enjoy our conversation.
So Peter, this is a totally unorthodox conversation for me, given I'm normally talking about business and investing, but we're going to talk about sort of history, politics, geography, demographics, all sorts of interesting topics.","Peter: [01:06:59] I've been very fortunate, so I don't know if I can narrow it down to just one. But I'm a kid from small town Iowa who leads an international life now. That could not have happened without my parents who were teachers, without my high school guidance counselor who got me out of some very sticky situations, without some of the college professors that made it all possible, without Rotary who gave me my scholarship to travel internationally, without my former colleagues at Stratford who beat the crap out of every idea I've ever had and made them stronger.

We discuss the past, present, and future of financial advice, financial technology, and investing. If you are a financial advisor or use one, this conversation is full of great history and perspective. Please enjoy.
I would love to begin with a sort of history, if you will, of the financial planning or advice model, If you could maybe tick the major stages of evolution that that model has gone through, and then we can begin by talking about where you think it might be going in the future.","Michael: [01:11:34] There's a gentleman in the industry named Bob Veres. Some folks in the advisor side will know him. He's published a practice management newsletter for the better part of I think almost 30 years now, a fantastic newsletter on financial advisor business and practice management. Back in the 2000s, like mid-2000s, I was starting to write articles in trade publications. I was doing retirement research and stuff on nerdy tax law and putting all that alphabet soup I was getting to good use. I kind of had this spark, this idea of Bob has this really successful business where he writes a newsletter, shares his expertise, and people pay him for it. It's pretty scalable, because it takes the same time to write the newsletter whether it's for 10 people, 100, 1,000, or more. Bob's made this work. I think I might try a newsletter business. Bob writes about practice management stuff. I'm going to write about nerdy planning strategies, because I was the planning nerd. I think I want to do this.I went and talked to Bob, just like, ""You are the guru. Am I nuts to try this business idea? Do you think there's something here? You've seen my articles, and you read a lot of stuff. Do you think I can do it?"" He said, ""Not only do I think you can do it, but I'm going to have my web developer make you a site and set up your technology using the same systems I use, so that you can get this launched and go do it."" He did. He did the whole thing. He covered it out of whatever his contractor agreement or whatever it is with his developer. He just stood up my first site, and got me launched, and then sent an email out to his mailing list saying, ""Michael Kitces has launched this cool newsletter. You like mine on practice management. He's on technical stuff. You're going to love it. Go sign up,"" and got me about 200 subscribers out of the gate.Standing up the website and giving me an initial base of subscribers wasn't a huge amount, that was probably $20,000 or $30,000 a year of revenue, but it was enough that paired together with some speaking and other stuff I was doing I was able to take that leap. Now, ultimately that morphed into my blog, and my blog morphed into a podcast, and that morphed into a whole bunch of businesses that I've created and all this other stuff that's come, but it all started with Bob Veres just not even giving me the initial nudge to go forward, but actually reaching out a hand and lifting me up to make it happen. It's part of why I've now been involved with starting up a lot of small businesses in our advisor space, just trying to seed good people that I think are doing good things that has a business opportunity and trying to give them the same hand up that Bob gave me.",Mentor,,,Promoted on platform,,

I hope you enjoy this wide-ranging conversation.
So, Alex, we're going to kind of go all over the place. I've heard you before, I've read a lot of your work. We will cover some of the same topics, but hopefully explore a lot of new ground as well. Probably good framing is just your day job. Describe what it is you do on the Discover Team at Social Capital, and then we'll kind of transition into current investment opportunities, bubbles, scarcity versus abundance, all these kind of interesting topics.","Alex: [01:26:29] Another sort of perpetual kindness in my life that I want to highlight is sort of my grandmother, my grandma from Montreal who I think just sort of is always one of those people that goes out of their way to make sure that people are just having the best day they can and knows that they're thinking of them. And really, it's a cross generational value. This idea that whatever it is that you're going through your life, whether it's happy times - like us expecting our first kid and moving in to a new city - or whether it's more difficult times, it's just sort of understanding that people have been there before you, people have worked through it, you always have help, you always have family who's there, you always have support who's there, I think that she's just somebody that I'm also unbelievably lucky to have in my life.

You can tell Keith is an entrepreneur at heart. So I enjoyed his energy and all that he has learned. Please enjoy.
Maybe we could begin with a sort of taxonomy of this world. So I know that Gelt specializes in apartments and mobile homes. We'll talk a lot about that in some detail, but maybe you could begin by describing why those two were attractive and kind of where those sit in an overall grouping or lineup of potential types of real estate investor.","Keith: [00:57:14] I'd say my father, he's been an amazing mentor, friend, father. He didn't need to support us in the beginning in terms of, literally he opened the door to his clients as potential investors. He did all the legal work for us, for the company. He really raised me right. He didn't just give us money. And anytime I borrowed money from him, it was with interest. And I paid him back. I grew up in a pretty well-off family but just, he raised me right. And I see that in some of my other friends that come from well off families, some of them are like that and some aren't.So I'd say the kind of thing he really did is the parenting and being able to allow me to grow and blossom, but just being able to be there if I ever had any questions and needed advice. So having a good role model and mentor, and I've had a lot of them in my life. And I think I try to pay it forward and be a role model and mentor to others. I'm always available. I love Twitter.

Actually, without taking absolutes because you're putting me on the spot, and people have done so many kind things for me. I'm basically indebted for life to those who've been close to me. I don't want to avoid acknowledging or accidentally acknowledge people who have been so kind. But one of the kindest things that's happened recently is one of our own entrepreneurs actually took me aside. It was actually over a text message, and we have a great relationship, and maybe that's what enabled them to do this. But they're like, I think that in certain contexts and conversations when you have a lot of preexisting insights, you get somewhat excited, and I notice that you're not asking the question or pausing, and you should take a look at active listening. I was just like, as the investor, you're used to being the professor, you're used to being, you should do this or whatever. And obviously, we try not to be overly dogmatic and listen and try to learn as much as we can. But I think it's an incredibly kind thing for somebody who's in the position of being the entrepreneur to be like, hey, I care about you. You should invest in this thing.",Peer,,,Critique,,

We discuss Eugene's concept of invisible asymptotes, why growth slows down for both companies and people and how some can burst through. I'd list more of the topics but we covered so much that you should just listen.
Finally, I'll say that after spending a day with Eugene, including a wildly interesting dinner with Eugene, past podcast guest, Sam Hinkie, and future podcast guests, Kevin Kwok, that he is the type of uniquely interesting and kind person I'm always searching for, and one that I wish I could bet on somehow.

I was out of undergrad, I had deferred law school because I just was like, ""I don't know if I really want to go to law school."" I was working a consulting job just to pay off my loans, and this was like '96-ish and I was like, ""Wow, this internet thing, I just love the internet, I just want to be in that space."" But I had very little work experience, very little qualifications and I really wanted to go work at Amazon because I loved books and I was buying all these books from Amazon, I was like, ""Oh, this is perfect.""And I looked on their website and all the job listings were like, ""Requires 10 years of computer science,"" or, ""10 years of experience,"" or, ""A master's."" And I ultimately applied for VP of business development, which is laughable. I'm an undergrad at college, it is like 10 years of experience required, I obviously didn't qualify. But I wrote a three-page cover letter outlining my passion for the company, why I wanted to work there. And a random recruiter at Amazon got my cover letter and she read it and she was like, ""Well, this guy's clearly not qualified for this position, however, I really like his cover letter, I'm going to pin it over my desk. And at some point, if something comes along, I'm going to call this person."" I got one of those, ""Thanks, we'll put you on file postcards.""And I didn't hear for six months and I was like, ""Okay, move on."" And she actually then found a position that she thought I qualified for, she called me six months later, I was in London on a case. And she was like, ""Hey, I'd like to have you come in,"" and I was like, ""Oh, okay."" And when I went, it's just one of those weird things where she didn't have to really do that, she was getting tons of letters. And she really just showed me that she had it pinned over her desk, and if I hadn't gone to Amazon, I really don't know. I mean, think of how different my life would be, that was my business school, that was my education and that was my entree into tech and all of that.

So I thought a really fun place to start would be early on in your career, specifically with your first experiences in the investing world, maybe even industries that you covered and describe those early experiences because I always like that as a framing for the bigger picture things that we'll talk about.",Tom: [00:43:29] Giving me my first job.,Boss,,,Took a chance,,

Keith is currently an investment partner at Khosla Ventures but has a story and diverse background as an investor, entrepreneur, and executive. He's worked in senior positions at PayPal, LinkedIn, and Square, has led investments in companies like Stripe, YouTube, Palantir, and Airbnb, and started the company Opendoor, which aims to transform the process of selling a home through technology. One fun fact about Keith is that he may have the most impressive list of bosses that I've ever seen, which we discuss during the episode. We cover a lot but one thing we kept returning to is business strategy. Keith's frameworks for gaining and building strategic advantage helped me clarify my thinking on the topic. And his examples of contrarian thinking will hopefully make you question some commonly held beliefs, please enjoy our conversation.","Keith: [00:56:23] Wow. I think the kindest things are all the same, actually, for me. The things that stick with me are people who remember and articulate in a really sync way, the impact I have in their career or life. In somewhat random in intervals, like sometimes it's expected occasion, but sometimes it's actually not. You have a lot of impact, fortunately, when you run large teams, build large teams, fun things, work on boards, and you don't always know. Technically, you obviously can track the impact, but it cascades down while you don't always get to track it. Then once in a while, it bubbles back up from people you didn't even really know that well, but that actually were inspired by particular things, learn particular things, change their course or trajectory. And when you get recognition back, it's usually private. Sometimes it's public. It's really super kind and rewarding and makes all the effort and sacrifice-",Employees,,,,Peers like employees or people under Keith,
Bryan Krug,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/8873621/krug-high-yield-credit-investing?tab=transcript,"My guest today is Bryan Krug, who manages the Artisan Partners Credit Team and overseas more than $3 billion in high yield credit investments for the firm. This was my first conversation on high yield, so I took it as an opportunity to get an overview on the investment universe and hone in on the tools used for analysis and security selection. As an equity investor, I think one of the most fruitful areas of research is into ways that companies fail or go wrong, and credit investors focus almost entirely on this potential for impairment. My guess is that all equity investors will learn something useful from this conversation, so please enjoy.
Maybe before we get into what opportunities are dangerous, the credit cycle creates at different points, you could outline, because this is the first time I've had any conversation with anyone specifically about the high yield of universe and really about fixed income in any level of detail, to be honest, I'm much more of an equity guy. So maybe highlight what that universe of high yield looks like, how it's defined, and from that definition, we'll kind of get into some of the more particulars.","Bryan: [00:50:42] I would say not one particular thing, but I'd say in general, I'd give my wife the credit, she raised our three kids and it's been really... I think it's been a sacrifice on her part to make sure that she... is a good influence, raises our kids, and allows me to basically work and do what I do. So that's probably the kindest thing that she's ever done.",Wife,,,Sacrifice,raising kids which lets him work,

I wish I could come up with one. I mean, there's so many. It's funny. I can think of examples of my ex-husband, who was very kind when we changed our relationship and became friends. I can think of my partner today, who was so kind to be with me throughout that process of really figuring out who I was, and separating from somebody I was with for 26 years. To me, I can think of my kids. I think of that part of my life, because that was incredibly tough. It was incredibly tough after 26 years to change a relationship. My kids, who held that space for me, and who well might have been upset and angry came back to me, and trusted me. To me, that's ...

Hunter Walk,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/11536501/walk-building-picks-and-shovels?tab=transcript,"My guest this week is Hunter Walk, the co-founder of Homebrew, a unique venture capital firm. Hunter is a tool-builder, having spent his career before venture at companies like Google and YouTube. The topic of our conversation is the intersection of creative expression, technology, human behavior and problem-solving. We discussed his time at the company behind the video game Second Life, building tools for creators at YouTube and why a very hands-on style of early stage venture investing represents an interesting use of his skillset at this stage of his career. Please enjoy my conversation with Hunter Walk.","Hunter: [01:14:32] I think the kindest thing that people can do is what I'd call bet on you early. Extend some of their own capacity. Extend a willingness to bring you to their table or give up their seat at the table for you. One of the things that comes to mind for me is there's a fellow venture capitalist who works at August Capital, David Hornik. He was a lawyer turned VC. His earliest VC years were when I was at Linden Lab. I remember he came in. He met us. Ended up not investing with us at that time but we maintained a little bit of a relationship.He started this great un-conference event called The Lobby about a dozen years ago. It was the idea that the best conversations happen in the lobby at every conference, not in the meeting room. It became this two-day, three-day, invite-only conference. It's a bunch of user-generated sessions. The programming is essentially created by the users. It's off the record conversations. You'd go and they can span very professional things but also very personal things. He invited me. I've paid for all 12 years and I've attended 11. There was one year that was a Google emergency. He invited me to the first one. I was just the mid-level product manager. I don't think I'd even gone over to YouTube yet. I was just doing some AdSense stuff. There's a bunch of bold-faced names to the left of me. Bold-faced names to the right of me. It allowed me to get out of my tunnel vision of just being within this big company. Learn about a lot of people talk about a lot of people. A few years later, I thanked him. I said, ""I didn't deserve to be at that first one."" He stopped me and he says like, ""You deserved to be at that first one. The world didn't know it yet but I did.""I always think about that because I've ended up through being in the right place at the right time. As my Comm's lead at YouTube said, ""Because you don't say stupid stuff and you have kind eyes,"" I'd get put on the road a lot. I'd try to explain the hard decisions we were making to reporters. I ended up with a set of relationships which turn into at least within, not celebrity, but within a small sliver of the San Francisco internet economy. I think it also benefits from having a name that's memorable. If my name was Adam Smith, I don't think people would remember me. I've ended up with a little bit of social media following, a little bit of people who care of what I think about. Every time I can use that to put a spotlight on somebody who quality of character is greater than reputation so far just because either they're young in their career. Or because they are uncomfortable in the spotlight.",Mentor,,,Took a chance,,
Cliff Asness,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/26747476/asness-the-past-the-present-future-of-quant?tab=transcript,"My guest this week is Cliff Asness the Managing and Founding Principal at AQR Capital Management. 20 years after its founding in 1998, AQR Manages $226 billion across a number of quantitatively based investing strategies. Cliff was an original quant researcher and he has long been one of the financial writers and thinkers that I look to for education and inspiration. I distinctly remember reading one paper in particular, Value and Momentum Everywhere somewhat early in my career and thinking, ""This is the kind of research I want to do forever."" You can always tell when talking to Cliff or hearing him speak that he just loves researching the markets. There's a deep intellectual honesty in his work and a respect for thinkers at different ends of the market spectrum, from Gene Fama to Ken French to Jack Bogle to Dick Thaler and Robert Shiller.
Our conversation is about all things quant, past, present, and future. Cliff touches on many of the big issues facing quant investing today and tells some great stories along the way. I hope you enjoy our conversation. Let's dive in.","Cliff: [01:19:41] The kindest thing anyone's ever done for me, it's related to my career. I had a few professors at Chicago who weren't even my direct kind of... The ones I was most close to, take some first drafts I wrote and re-write them, just rip them apart. It was a cruel kind thing. I'll give a shout out to Cam Harvey, a wonderful Editor of the Journal of Finance for many years. He took one of my papers early on and it was very nice, because he thought I was onto an interesting idea. I guess it was a complement, because I don't think he would rip apart and... and he literally re-wrote like a three page introduction anew for me which I thought was just incredibly generous.And I always, in the same vein have to add my two dissertation advisers Fama and French, probably the luckiest thing in my career was being their student at the right time and I don't know if kind is the right word, but they didn't have to take me on as a student. They didn't take many students. So luck, blessed to be there at the right time and to have them... Gene Fama being okay with me writing a dissertation on price momentum, that one might be closer to a pure act of kindness. You might have heard me tell the story before, but I was genuinely terrified to tell him. I had found this Jegadeesh and Titman, definitely ahead of me, but I had found it independently and was all excited about... Was very disappointed and found out they had found it, too.But I went to tell Gene, I did a lot of the work, because you don't go there with just an idea, you go there with empirics, and I'm like, ""Professor,"" I didn't call him Gene then... I still don't call him Gene... He tells him to call him Gene and I call him professor. ""I want to write a dissertation on price momentum,"" and then I mumbled the second part. ""I find it works well."" He like, ""What was that?"" I'm like, ""And it works very well."" Because it's a Gene Fama-esque, Chicago-esque dissertation to say, ""These crazy people on Wall Street chase these price trends and they don't add value and after transactions cost, subtract value,"" and Gene would never do this, but there's an implied, ""Ha, ha, they're foolish again. A strategy, and again maybe one day someone will come up with an efficient market risk based explanation.""People have tried, I don't think they've particularly succeeded at that but it is not a wonderful result for the efficient market hypothesis that 12 month price momentum is an effective strategy. Now I wasn't stupid enough to say this, do this instead of value. That would have been both bad portfolio management, because they work well together and also bad graduation strategy, bad dissertation strategy. But Gene said to me, and it's funny, it took me a little while, but this is probably one of the nicest things I've ever heard and it was almost a religious statement from him.He kind of paused for a second and he said, ""If it's in the data, write the paper."" Which for him was kind of like the ultimate ethical statement and I did and he wanted me to go on the academic job market with him but I ended up staying at Goldman but he was very supportive of the paper. Even though to this day, I don't think he's the biggest fan of momentum investing out there. The firm he works with DFA, doesn't incorporate it into their process so I'm sure that means Gene must have signed off at some point, because I don't think anyone's allowed to do something if Gene absolutely hates it.",Professor,,,Critique,,
Ryan Caldbeck,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/20185060/caldbeck-quant-in-private-markets?tab=transcript,"My guest this week is Ryan Caldbeck, a private equity investor who wants to bring quantitative rigor to the private markets. Ryan is a CEO of CircleUp, which uses a system it calls Helio to identify attractive investments in early stage consumer brands. While I am of course a fan of quantitative investing, I also know from experience how much harder private markets are than public markets when it comes to the transactions themselves. We discuss this, and many other potential roadblocks to bringing models to private markets. Using many individual companies as examples, Ryan explains some of the predictive factors they've uncovered in their research. We also discusse which parts of the private markets might be infiltrated by quant processes first, and which may never be. I expect many more to go on a journey similar to Ryan's in the years to come. His serves as an interesting example for ambitious investors out there. Please enjoy our conversation.
So, I think a fun device for this conversation would be to treat the core model of your business, Helio, at CircleUp, as almost like a biography of it. So maybe we'll start at its infancy or even the sparkle in your eyes, so to speak, begin by telling us what this is, and start at the earliest days, how did you conceive of it and begin building it?","Ryan: [01:05:13] I love this question. I grew up in a small town in Vermont called Shelburne, and both of my parents were small town lawyers, they worked together in a private practice about a hundred yards away from where our house was. I started playing basketball relatively late in life - around I'm seventh grade or so, and by the time I was a sophomore in high school, I knew I wanted to try and play in college. So my dad used to leave work everyday to go rebound for me. He'd leave work around three o'clock, and we were middle class, for him to take off a couple hours in the afternoon everyday, he was foregoing income. He didn't work as part of a larger firm that would still pay him a salary, when he didn't work he didn't get paid. So he did this everyday for three years, he'd come and rebound for me for two or three hours, and then we go home, and have dinner, and do homework.One point, midway through my junior year we were kind of talking while I'm doing shooting drills, and he's rebounding, we're talking about college basketball - not about me, to be candid with you, - but about, I think Syracuse, and I shot the ball, he caught it, and he held it, and he wouldn't pass it back to me. And he said, ""You know, you could play for Syracuse,"" and I just said, ""Dad, I'm a mediocre player. I'm barely starting for a poor team in not a basketball hotbed."" To give you a sense for it, Vermont hadn't had - you can count on one hand the number of people who have played college basketball outside of the state of Vermont in the last 20 years. I said, ""Dad, I'm not going to be able to play for Syracuse, that's never going to happen."" He said, ""You don't believe in yourself enough. If you saw what I saw, you could do it. You could do anything if you believe in yourself more."" It sounds, I don't know if it sounds corny or whatever, but he just said it with so much conviction, and so much belief.I've thought about that moment at so many different points of my life. I ended up going to do Duke for college, and I ended up trying to make the team, I ended up playing at Duke. Trying to get into consulting, trying to get into business school at Stanford, a number of different things, even starting CircleUp, and I look back at that memory at each of those points of my life, and I'm just so grateful that he, in that moment, and in so many other moments, was able to inject in me confidence, and a self-worth that led me to just want to try. I think that that is so critical to being an entrepreneur, but more importantly I'm just - as a parent myself now - I think what a special thing. Is there anything better that you could give your kids than the self-worth and confidence to want to try, so that's the kindest thing anyone's ever done to me.",Father,,,Gave self-confidence,encouragement,
Howard Lindzon,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/45761005/lindzon-fintech-and-trend-following?tab=transcript,"My guest this week aspires to be the Larry David of investing, and we discuss why. Howard Lindzon is hard to categorize. He's primarily an early-stage investor right now but he's participated in all types of investing. He describes himself as a trend follower and always has a unique take on popular topics. In this conversation, we cover his investing history and his take on the fintech investing landscape today.
What I'll remember most is the idea that we should focus on what is happening versus what we think will happen or might happen. There is a Peter Lynch-like quality to some of Howard's thinking, and a willingness to embrace the weird that I find very appealing. The few times I've met Howard, I've smiled or laughed most of the time, which is about as nice a thing as I could say about anybody. He's a good example of why I like this podcast format: his investing style bears literally no resemblance to my own, but it got me thinking about a lot of new things. I hope you enjoy our conversation.","Howard: [00:45:17] I would say it would have to be my wife. She just puts up with every day kindness of being distant or whatever, the entrepreneur life and the nomad lifestyle that I have, so I think just every day that she just kind of forgives me. There's always a fight because I'm just doing something dumb. So, that would be the daily kindness thing. My daughter will send me these nice texts, she's just lucky ... again, she'll just make me share her texts with people. I'll screen cap it and go ""Who thinks like this as a 21-year old?"" So, thoughtful. They continue to be the kindest people to me.My son is mean to me, so that makes up for it. He just can't help himself, and I'm over that. There is a point where every dad with their son must go through this. I was warned about it being the daughter, but it turned out to be my son. I'm best friends with my son, play golf together, he thinks my friends are cool, he thought I was cool, and then fucking something went off and his head and he was like ""I hope you die."" He didn't probably think that, but he looked at me like that. I was the Antichrist. My daughter, who I was told was going to think that, never went through that phase with me, she just thinks I'm weird and likes me. My son thinks I'm weird and leave him alone. So, that was hard.The kindness is my daughter and my wife, and obviously my friends just are always nice to me, but kindness has changed. It used to be like ""Pick me up at the airport,"" that was what I associated ... My dad would say ""Pick me up,"" and I'd go ""Fuck ... Take a cab."" You know what I mean? So, thank God for Uber. It killed the airport pick-up. That's a kindness thing, too. Uber is one of the kindest things. It's saving lives. We can talk about how mean they are and blah, blah, blah, but let's stop this because you know what? There is a risk with everything. That's the kindest, weirdest company because it's created so much joy and weirdness from its ... and serendipity.",Wife,,,Forgiveness,,

This was one of the most interesting conversations I've had in the world of cryptocurrency, primarily because we don't talk about Bitcoin or crypto until about 25 minutes into the talk. Instead, we focus on history, economics, sound money, low time preference and gold, all interesting topics. Saif's thinking on cryptocurrencies, other than Bitcoin, which is that they are worthless is unique and thought-provoking. His reasoning around why gold shouldn't be compared to the returns generated by assets like equities was also compelling. If you followed my hash power episodes, this is a new and differentiated interpretation of Bitcoin as a technology with a store of value use case specifically.

Please enjoy our conversation.
Thank you so much for being here with me today. I think a great place to start would be for you to begin with a description of sound money. It's such an important central concept in the book. This will probably be the least technical of the various cryptocurrency conversations I've had, which is refreshing for me. I'm certainly no economist, but your take on Bitcoin and its role in sort of the modern world is fascinating. So I think sound money is the perfect place to start because it's such a pervasive concept in your writing.",Saifedean: [01:07:15] The kindest thing?

Jeremiah Lowin,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/92590658/lowin-machine-learning-in-investing?tab=transcript,"My guest this week is one of my best and oldest friends, Jeremiah Lowin. Jeremiah has had a fascinating career starting with advanced work in statistics before moving into risk management in the hedge fund world. Through his career, he has studied data, risk, stats, and machine learning, the last of which is the topic of our conversation today. He has now left the world of finance to found a company called Prefect, which is a framework for building data infrastructure. Prefect was inspired by observing frictions between data scientists and data engineers and solves these problems with a functional API for defining and extricating data workflows. These problems, while wonky, are ones I can relate to working in the quantitative investing world, and others that suffer from them out there will be nodding their heads right now.
In full and fair disclosure, both me and my family are investors in Jeremiah's business. You won't have to worry about that potential conflict of interest in today's conversation, though, because our focus is on the deployment of machine learning technologies in the realm of investing. What I love about talking to Jeremiah is that he is both an optimist and a skeptic. He loves working with new statistical learning technologies, but often thinks they are overhyped or entirely unsuited to the tasks they are being used for. We get into some deep detail on how tests are set up in this world, the importance of data, and how the minimization of error is a guiding light in machine learning and perhaps all of human learning, too.

I had an investor come on to me and I was in a tailspin, this was in 2013. And she's like, ""Come out, I'll just take care of you and let you have a break from your business.""I've had other people that said just the right thing just the right time, or that we're willing to get on the phone with me with only an hour or two notice when I need advice. And so I don't know that there's a singular item or situation that's rising to the top but I don't know if there's and I don't think I could be where I am today if it hadn't been for the help of so many others and so now I do my best to pay it forward.

Richard Craib,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/80983582/craib-crowdsourcing-predictive-algorithms?tab=transcript,"I intentionally avoid the world of quantitative investing on this podcast. The whole point of this format is to learn about many different fields and the vast majority of my time is already spent in the quant world. Occasionally, I've broken this rule because of something unique, including this week's conversation with Richard Craib, the founder and CEO of Numerai. If you listen to the podcast often, you'll have heard me reference Numerai, a hedge fund which blends quant investing, cryptocurrencies, crowdsourcing, and machine learning. Talk about a PR company's dream. One important note, Numerai is both incredibly open and very secretive. You may sense a bit of frustration on my part, but that is only because as a fellow quant who loves details about data and modeling, we couldn't go deeper into the details on the record.
We discussed how Numerai has created an incentive structure to work with data scientists around the world in an attempt to build better investing models. The idea of having data scientist stake cryptocurrency in support of the quality of their models is fascinating to me. Like many hedge funds, Numerai doesn't share its track record, so we don't know if this works. But I hope you, like me, use this conversation as inspiration for how different technologies can intersect.","Richard: [00:46:30] Coming to mind is the early parts of Numerai where I came to Silicon Valley without any connections here. I was coming from South Africa. Howard Morgan, the co-founder of Renaissance Technologies, was our first investor and he has a similar thing, I think, where he's not in a time in his career where he wants to just invest in things that are nothing but making money.

Our talk is centered on what makes for a good investment and even more specifically; how Elad identifies an interesting market. Operators and early stage investors will find lots of nuggets in this fun conversation. Please enjoy.
What is your general process for evaluating a young business and getting involved?","Elad: [00:32:29] In my mind, Silicon Valley is a place where people very openly give back and I've been helped enormously by that ethos throughout my career. And fundamentally I think that - you know, there's the old saying that you die from a 1,000 small cuts - I think in Silicon Valley, I've benefited from a 1,000 small acts of kindness that have sort of built up over time. When I moved out here, I had literally no money and I was in school debt and everything else. And I was sleeping on the floor of an apartment that I rented. I didn't have a bed for the first two years. I was just literally sleeping on a sleeping bag and lots of people went out of their way to help me, to introduce me to companies I could join. And so really, I think I just benefited from that collective, ""Hey, we think this person is smart and we'll take a shot on them as an ethos."" And that ethos to me is the most important thing out here.",Stranger,,,Took a chance,,
Brent Beshore,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/77276674/beshore-what-you-learn-about-business?tab=transcript,"For the 100th episode I've brought back my good friend Brent Beshore. Brent was the 10th guest on the podcast after we met because of a mutual interest in capital allocation. I quickly learned that Brent was one of the most unique and thoughtful investors around. He was an entrepreneur from the moment he left school, trying many different things before finding a fit buying smaller businesses with the intention of owning them forever. What amazes me about Brent is his encyclopedic understanding of business and the nuances of different business models and deal structures. This comes from reps. He and his team have looked at about 12,000 deals over the years at every kind of business that you can imagine. I've been with him when he goes through this process and it's fun to hear what makes certain businesses stand out from others, which is largely the topic of this conversation.
You all know transparency is key for me, so it's important to know that my family and I are investors in a fund called Permanent Equity Fund One run by Brent and his firm AdVentures. To commemorate this milestone episode I can think of no one better than Brent because he exemplifies what has made this podcast so fun for me: learning from other people who are willing to share what they themselves have learned through fun, blood, sweat, and tears. Please enjoy our conversation and thank you so much for coming along on this journey. I can't tell you how much it means to me.",Question not found,,,,,,
"Boyd Varty, Bronwyn Varty",https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/67257707/varty-the-art-of-presence?tab=transcript,"Today's conversation is a continuation of my discussion on applying the lessons of tracking animals in the wild to tracking in your own life. I encourage you to listen to yesterday's episode first. In this second part, Boyd's sister, Bronwyn, joins and offers perspective on business and life. Given that Boyd and Bron grew up in this wild place, their perspective on the world is refreshing and very different. We discuss a wide range of things, but the section on restoration near the end is just phenomenal stuff. Please enjoy part two of my conversation with the Varty family.
We were having a conversation at lunch and I don't want to lose this thread, this track, so to speak, which is some of the common things that you both see when you're working with people whether they come here or whether it's somewhere else, and we were talking about shame as an interesting concept and problem that people deal with. I think it'd be fun to talk about some of the problems, actually, and the common threads you see across people with these problems. I'd love to just get your perspective on the notion of shame and the role that it plays.","[01:00:55] It's so hard for me because I live in a such a wave of kindness. I have this innate idea that everything's happening for me, and so to single out... Kindness for me is I know days it's just a look, and that's enough, that just completely changes the whole spectrum around me. And having the luxury of being able to notice kindness no matter how big or small has changed my life fundamentally. It's taken me into a profound state of grace and a profound seeking of grace. And so the moment of kindness that really shifted for me was probably a kindness in the realization of myself. I don't know if that makes sense to you, but to wake up... I remember waking up one morning here at Londolozi and realizing where I was. And yet I had lived here my whole life. But it was a moment and I remember it so clearly where I walked out of my front door, and in walking out of my front door, I just started to notice the tiniest little details, the way that the light came through the aloes, and the way that the little sunbirds were sticking their perfectly formed beaks into the flowers and sucking out the nectar. And the way that every single thing had its moment in time, and the way that I had seen them my whole life, but today I was actually seeing them. And how each one of them was totally connected to me, and whatever I did would affect them, and whatever they did would affect me. And that idea landed kindness for me in a way that just… I was always big on care, and I think what shifted is that in kindness there was a way of being. And so even when someone is not being kind, I find the kindness in them. So I don't know if that really answers your question, but-",,,,,,
Boyd Varty,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/55010378/varty-live-like-a-tracker?tab=transcript,"An interesting question that I think about a lot. How do you balance exploring the new with savoring what you already know and love? Most of the time I prefer to explore but the best part of this podcast experience for me has been meeting people who have become close friends. For episodes 99 and 100 I'm bringing back two of the most popular past guests who are now both dear friends. This week's episode is split into two parts, today and tomorrow. Today's episode is with Boyd Varty and tomorrow is with both Boyd and his sister Bronwyn. The incredible Varty family hosted me in South Africa. So you'll hear birds and elephants in the background as we talk. This conversation with Boyd is about our shared experience called Track Your Life, which I could not recommend more highly. We tracked animals on foot for five days and learnt a ton from the environment itself. While we discuss our time together, this is much more about how to live. My original conversation with Boyd had a huge impact on me. And this continues the exploration of Boyd's idea that we should all be going our own way in the right way instead of simply following well-trodden paths. I hope you enjoy this conversation with Boyd and check back tomorrow for another conversation with the Vartys.",Question not found,,,,,,

My guest is Ryan Selkis, who I met at an event hosted by Union Square Ventures in BlockTower Capital.
At that event, in a crowd of many brilliant people, Ryan was consistently asking hard questions and raising counterpoints. I love his perspective, because he is both passionate, but realistic, excited about crypto, but worried about many aspects of the ecosystem. We discuss many new topics like his barbell analogy for thinking about different kinds of coins, Token-Curated Registries, a fascinating topic, and the need for better transparency around decentralized projects. Please enjoy this conversation.","Ryan: [00:52:53] I've joked around with this guy, Annie, from Fabric VC. He and I were joking that, and I forget who came up with the title, but for my auto-biography, it'll be something like, ""My entire life has been an accident."" I've just caught a tremendous amount of breaks, but I think that by far, the - obviously, my parents, and wife for family reasons.But I would say when I started my career, it was in the throes of the recession, and my offer at the J.P. Morgan investment bank was deferred. I think it would have been a pretty significant setback, just psychologically and career-wise because I accepted on the spot, the summer prior, and so I went back to the well for the friends that I had that would have recruited me, I thought.And this guy, J.P. Sanday, who's a friend of mine at Boston College, he was like, ""Yeah, we'll get you in right away."" And so, he fast-tracked me at a venture firm called Summit Partners, which I'm sure most of your listeners probably know. And it worked out. Within like two weeks, I went from, ""Okay, my career has got a major setback. We're going into of the throes of the worst recession since the great depression,"" and then somehow miraculously went from that to, ""I just skipped two years of banking and got right into venture."" And it was the best job that I possibly could have had out of school. I was totally under-qualified for it, and pretty much everybody at Summit that hired me and then didn't fire me in the first three years. And then, my manager, Pete Connolly, who was just terrific first mentor and coach, I'd say.",Peer,,,Intros,introduction to his first job out of college during the recession,
Cathie Wood,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/18959435/wood-investing-in-innovation?tab=transcript,"My guest this week is Cathie Wood, the founder of ARK Invest. Cathie and her team believe that disruptive innovation is the key to long term growth and therefore, alpha in public markets. Because their style of investing is entirely contingent on what will happen and change in the future, it is about as different a style as exists from the quantitative approach to investing, which relies on what is currently knowable about stocks and businesses. The future is notoriously hard to predict, so I'm always interested to hear about investing approaches which try to model and handicap the future and build portfolios against that work. In this conversation, we explore all the most interesting and exciting technology trends at play in the world today, and how those trends may play out for investors. We discuss genome sequencing, blockchain, software 2.0, mobility as a service, automation, and more. We also discuss Cathie's take on building a bridge between the worlds of finance and Silicon Valley, and why starting with a benchmark is anathema to their process. It's hard to deny Cathie's passion and enthusiasm, and I credit her for building a unique firm culture that emphasizes openness and collaboration. Please enjoy our conversation on investing in innovation.","Cathie: [01:08:15] There are many kinds of things, I think I mean this is the sharing kindness begets kindness. So I try to be a kind person myself. I remember, this was actually the beginning of my journey to end up starting this firm. In 2006, I was just so depressed, because I was in a situation where because of the tech and telecom bust, there had been already a shift towards benchmark style investing. And so that's how we were judged. Even though I could say till I was blue in the face, give me 5 years, give me whatever, trough to trough. Give me something. And I remember that you're underperforming and I should never, ever have let myself get this way because I consider this today worshiping an idol, the almighty benchmark which I should never, ever have fallen into that trap or let anyone make me feel any which way about it. But I did.The market was up, I don't know, we underperformed by 1,100 basis points. So I think the market was up 16% and we were up only 5%, something like that. Well, that never happened in my strategy. We've got beta and alpha going for us usually in a year like that. And instead, it was a commodity cycle. And I just remembered being very depressed, and I don't know if you've ever heard of him. You should interview him if you haven't. And I'm speaking about kindness from a professional point of view. That's how I'm limiting it to this conversation, but he gave me a plaque with a saying on it. And it's in my house today. And it said something like, it's from an ancient philosopher. And it was the most beautiful thing in the world was seeing the mighty, the brilliance, and whatever other words you use as a person who's, I'm going to rephrase it. Who is under the gun and suffering, how they strive to overcome that. And obviously, this is from ancient times. Everybody has gone through this. I happened to create an idol that I should never haved worship. So not happy that I felt that way. But he believed in what we were doing so much that he wanted to encourage me and tell me, ""Look, fight on. Keep going. You're going to win.""",Mentor,,,Gift,"the gift was of words of encouragement, so not sure how to define",
Bethany McLean,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/65880978/mclean-business-gone-bad-and-the-art-of-persistence?tab=transcript,"I've often heard that good investors are a bit like journalists, doggedly collecting evidence and building an understanding of how all the pieces of a company or an investment fit together. My guest this week is one of my favorite writers and journalists, Bethany McLean. Across her career, Bethany has covered many of the most interesting stories in business and investing from Enron, which became the famous book and documentary, The Smartest Guys in the Room, to Valeant, Wells Fargo, SAC Capital, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the great financial crisis, and most recently Fracking in the Energy Revolution. Given how deeply she has investigated all of these topics and thought about the common threads that cross them all, this was an amazing conversation.
When talking to her, you can feel how much he cares and how diligent and fair she is when analyzing a topic. In addition to all the great stories I already listed, we discussed the Art of Persistence and the other lessons she has learned about businesses and people gone bad. I especially loved her evolving take on housing in America. Please enjoy this great conversation with Bethany McLean.","Bethany: [00:55:23] So I guess I'm going to pick probably Joe Nocera taking an interest in my work from a work perspective. Joe Nocera taking an interest in my work early on at Fortune and helping me take the Enron story from a story into something that became a book and then a fundamental part of my career. And I don't think if it had been, not for his level of interest and help along the way and for less credit than he got in the sense that orchestrated the book, but his name isn't on it. I think the path of my career probably would have been different. And then on a personal level, I guess I would probably say my husband because he always rises above. And instead of taking petty little comments and making them into a big deal, he dismisses the petty little comments and rises above. And if you do that, that sets a precedent where both people rise above and see the good and the other person and the other person's comments rather than the bad. And it creates a virtuous cycle instead of a vicious cycle of squabbling and it makes life much better.",Boss,,,Took a chance,took a chance in work at fortune,
Modest Proposal,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/31464082/proposal-value-is-dead-long-live-value?tab=transcript,"A very short introduction today, because my guest is anonymous. Suffice to say, he manages a large pool of private capital. He goes by the pseudonym, Modest Proposal, and his Twitter presence is one of the reasons I first got on and now stay on that platform. He's levelheaded, smart, and skeptical by nature, all of which made for a great conversation. We discussed how difficult the market has become for active investors, thematic investment opportunities, and the potential sources of market mispricings. Please enjoy our conversation and let me know what other anonymous accounts you'd like to hear from.
So the framing of this conversation is going to be value investing, weird overreactions, mispricings in what has become a very competitive and difficult market. Maybe just start by giving your impression of how value investing specifically has changed. Maybe what you view as the drivers of the historical out performance of value, and whether or not those same conditions or that same opportunity set exists at all today.","Modest Proposal: [01:36:28] I think it's got to be on the personal side. There are people who've helped me professionally, but on the personal side, my parents divorced when I was about six months old. And so my mom had two kids under the age of four and we moved back, we moved 3000 miles across the country and she was a single mom, two kids, no job. And she started dating a guy who ultimately became my stepfather. And I always appreciated how incredibly generous and amazing he was to support us when we weren't his kids. And to take us on at that age when he was a grad student and didn't have full-time income yet. As I've gotten older and sort of experienced the responsibilities of having a family and having kids, I think it resonates even more that, ""Wow, I don't know if when I was in my early thirties, I started dating a woman who had two kids, that is a big order."" And for him to have done it and provide me and my siblings with the opportunity that we got, as much as I was appreciative at the time, I think in retrospect, it's just the magnitude of that is even greater where I say, ""Wow, who knows where I'd be, but I probably wouldn't be here without that set of kindness.",Stepfather,,Family,Support,,
Niel Robertson,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/91357315/robertson-the-future-of-media?tab=transcript,"This week's episode covers a new set of topics. The conversation with Niel Robertson covers media, eSports, content distribution, marketing and a lot more. Niel started a software company out of his bedroom when he was 14 years old, and sold his first company in 1999 for $280 million when he was just 24. He has started and sold other companies to Twitter and Cisco. He started another large business that ultimately failed. He's been an investor, venture partner and serial entrepreneur. You can find more about Niel's background in the show notes.
As I often do, I cut the long background section from the interview so that we can get right to the meat of things. But Niel concluded that section saying, ""I think it could all be summed up by saying I just like building things and I can't stop doing it."" In addition to the overall media landscape, we discussed the role that the biggest media platforms will play and where other opportunities may exist. We cover digital collectible stored on the blockchain and what type of digital assets may be leased out to others. We close with the discussion of leadership, company structure, content creation, and something you should do each year. Please enjoy this unique conversation with Niel Robertson.","Niel: [00:57:36] I think probably the kindest and most impactful thing that happened to me was, in the first business we built, Service Metrics, that was the one I moved to Colorado for, the guy that was running the business, his name is Tom Higley, the kindest thing he did was let me be involved. There wasn't a part of the business that he just cordoned off and said, ""I don't want you in the board meetings. I don't want you to talk in the marketing, I don't want to do anything."" He gave me some room to run. And I put a hell lot of work into that business to try to not make that a bad decision on his part. And I think that was probably the kindest thing he could have done because he changed my opinion about what I wanted to be from someone that just told technology stories to someone that built business stories. And I think that access was everything. So yeah, that's what comes to mind.",,,,,,

We cover all aspects of ETFs in some detail, and luckily in ways that have little overlap with a few other recent ETF centric episodes on two of my favorite podcasts, the Meb Faber show and Capital Allocators with Ted Seides.
Those conversations were with Matt Haugen and Tom Light and respectively. We open with Eric's favorite ETF tickers, discuss the pros and cons of ETFs versus other investment vehicles and explore the largest areas of opportunities for new ETFs coming to market in the years to come. ETFs have become the vehicle of choice for many investors. So it's about time we covered them in depth in this forum.

And I remember I had gotten a dog in New York and the dog was all over the place, I didn't train the dog right. I was, it was just, I was having like a quarter-life crisis. And she took me in, helped me buy a car. And I really, I reformed my life living in her house for six months. I remember the dog got all muddy and ran through her house. And I really shouldn't have been a 28-year-old back at her house. Although now it's normal to live with your parents for a long time.But I got to say her. I mean, she's just, that was probably the nicest thing was just to not judge, just help me get back on my feet. So the other one would be my wife just marrying me. I mean, if that hadn't happened, we wouldn't be sitting here today. The amount of times I bring home, some tizzy I'm in and my wife just sets me straight and I don't reply emotionally to some email or something. I can tell you that has protected me from so many snares. Obviously our family and all that's great too, but just, I cannot understate how amazing that is for me, especially me, because I'm sometimes not good left to my own devices, but I would say those two, it's a toss up.

The topic of our conversation is the use of data in the investment process to help cultivate what is commonly referred to as an information edge. I call the episode Tim Cook's dashboard because of an interesting question that Michael poses. If you aren't the best Apple analyst in the world, with Tim Cook's private business dashboard, telling him everything going on in the Apple universe that day, what might that be worth?
Effectively, Michael's goal is to recreate the equivalent of a company dashboard for many businesses helping analysts understand the fundamental health and direction of companies a bit better than the market does. And in so doing, creating an actionable edge. This is a daunting task and you will hear why. It requires both a fundamental understanding of business and of data statistics and methods like machine learning. In our own work, we found machine learning to be useless for predicting future stock prices, but extremely useful for other things like extracting and classifying data.","Michael: [00:58:59] I do have exactly the kind of thing, and it's a bit of a story. So when I was... I grew up in a working-class background, and I had started in school, because my older brother was in the remedial thread, they actually put me in the remedial thread. So the first few years of my education, I was actually in the remedial thread. So you were in these large classrooms, and they couldn't even try to teach you. So I read lots of books, and I was reading this book by George Gamow called One, Two, Three...Infinity, and I was trying to approximate pi using circumscribed and inscribed polygons of increasing side.And I had worked something out and I went and asked my math teacher, and he lifted me out of the remedial program and put me in the gifted program that day. And then I arrived in the gifted program, And they're all these kids in the gifted program, who had been in there for their whole career. And they were a little bit sort of comfortable. And I was just like, ""Wow, someone wants to teach you something."" And it really got me accelerated in terms of, I mean, there's someone teaching me something, and the more I work, the more I got taught.And you know, I'm where I am today because of that teacher who actually lifted me out of that program and put me into the other program. And so, really what motivated me to go become a professor was that I want to do the same thing. And I teach working-class folks, because there's so many people who just... with lots of students, I can find the math teacher who convinced them they weren't good at math. And they stopped trying to learn. And so I've done lots of work in terms of teaching just because of feeling I could want to give back to that one teacher in sixth grade who actually lifted me out of the remedial program.",Teacher,,,Took a chance,recognized she was good at math,

Of particular interest are the ways in which Ash and his team evaluate data sets and how they think about competitive advantage in this new world, where Ash advocates a new term to replace the concept of the moat, something he calls loops. If we can use data to do things better than humans, or if we can supercharge our intuition with predictive models, we can harness the power of this new technology.

But really I think the kindest thing anyone's ever done for me, I picked the earliest example of this, but subsequent people have also done this. It's my economics teacher in my final year of high school. Sorry, my penultimate year of high school. He realized pretty quickly that I sort of got it, and I read ahead a bit, and I understood all the concepts and whatever. So he said, ""Look, I'm going to test you. I'm going to give you the final exam in a month."" So this is a two year course. ""In a month I'll give you the final exam. Basically if you pass it you can just never turn up to class again and do your thing."" And I did. So I had two years of semi guided self-study, where I could read Adam Smith's book in the original text, or I could go and play crosswords, or I could learn about genetics from my really smart biology friend, or I could go back and do some economics stuff and sit and trade for an hour, or whatever. But the thing is this teacher, he just let me run with it. He let me run with my interests, because he could tell I was really interested in economics and I was not moving at the same pace, and he just let me go with it.

Mike Zapata,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/14746744/zapata-the-darkest-night-lessons-from-battle-and-value-investing?tab=transcript,"My guest this week is remarkable. He now applies his talents on Wall Street, searching for smaller cap companies trading at huge discounts in an effort to compound wealth for his investors. He's classically trained, having earned his graduate degree from Columbia, a school known for producing value investors. But his method also reflects what he learned across more than a decade of active duty in the US military. Mike Zapata served us all as a Navy SEAL in the aftermath of 9/11, and ultimately, as a member of the SEAL's Development Group, commonly known as SEAL Team Six.
I think everyone listening strives for excellence in what they do. This week, we get to hear from someone who has pursued excellence on our behalf. I'll let him explain the meaning of his firm's name, Sententia, but for now, suffice to say we are lucky to have quiet professionals like Mike. If you're interested in supporting the families of soldiers who fought with Mike and lost their lives, I encourage you to check out the Tip of the Spear foundation and make a donation along with me, small or large. Please enjoy my conversation with Mike Zapata.","Mike: [00:55:18] Believe. It sounds like just a broad answer, but the fact that people have trust and confidence in you to do well, to take that and to be able to prove that is something that's really, really important. So I think that throughout my life, there's been supporters. Like I said, we stand on the shoulders of giants and without the support that I've had from the mentors, without learning from them - their time, their insights is incredibly valuable, and to be able to learn that and I'm really appreciative of that.People like Michael and Mario and Bill. Even Michael here in this office, it is just incredible to be supported by that. To me, another component of Sententia, again is, how do we give back? The better we do, the more we can give back and I think that we want to return that to people we can return it to, and I think that our community gives a lot and those families give a lot. So how do we best support them and just trying to take what we learn here, give it back to that community. But time and mentorship, I think is valuable.",Mentor,,,Believed in me,,
Sam Hinkie,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/21379104/hinkie-data-decisions-and-basketball?tab=transcript,"I came across this week's guest, thanks to the overlap of three passions of mine data informed investing, value creation and basketball. Sam Hinkie worked for more than a decade in the NBA with the Houston Rockets and then most recently served as president and general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers. He helped launch basketball's analytics movement when he joined The Rockets in 2005 and is known for unique trade structuring and a keen focus on acquiring undervalued players. Today, he's also an investor and an advisor to a limited number of young companies in which he feels his experience can improve outcomes. At one point in our conversation, Sam mentioned that he tracked success by a future financial outcomes, much like we would in the investing world. So I did some research and found many interesting stats about the Sixers surrounding Sam's tenure.
When he took over the franchise, it was 24th in ESPN franchise rankings. Today, it is fourth. This is the result of an impressive crop of young talent players like all-star Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, which resulted in large part from unconventional decisions that Sam and his team made. While I'm sure these estimates are imperfect, Forbes estimated the Sixers value at about $418 million when Sam took over and $1.2 billion just a few months ago. Now NBA teams in general have grown in value, so a lot of that appreciation is the equivalent of market beta. But given that the 76ers had the top percentage growth number more recently of any team in the league, some of it is alpha too.","Sam: [01:03:58] I was 10 years old and we had a real tragedy in our family that was hard. And one of my best friends at the time was this guy named JJ Smith and his father, his dad's, his name is John Smith. A lot of people came to be supportive for our family, which was great and he came in that moment and he'd been there an hour or two and he came back into this bedroom where I was and he said, ""You want to come with me?"" And I said, ""Sure."" And I went with him and I went into his backyard and his son was there and he and his son and I played basketball for all the rest of the day and most of the night and it got me out of a situation that no 10 year old wants to be in.And it's something I've just never forgotten of what that took. I don't think he knew at the time how meaningful it would be, but even now it's meaningful to me because it was a real act of kindness and it sort of got me out of a particular situation that was better for me to deal with in a different way and allowed me to find this refuge in a game I loved at the time when I really needed it.",Friend's dad,,,Help in time of need,,
Tren Griffin,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/69453131/griffin-pulling-the-thread?tab=transcript,"My guest this week is a bundle of curiosity, and that is one of the nicest things I could say about anybody. For several years, Tren Griffin has been writing a weekly blog post that highlights what he has learned from various investors, business people, musicians, comedians and more. Lately, he's also been tackling individual businesses and broad topics like scaling, competitive forces and product-market fit. Tren's full-Time job is serving as a director at Microsoft. He's also worked with, or for several well-known business people and investors like Craig McCall and written several books, including one on lessons for entrepreneurs, one on Charlie Munger and another on negotiation.
We discuss value creation versus value capture, alpha and investing, sales, hip-hop and why he teach high school students about convexity through a drunk driving analogy. I could have talked to Tren for much longer than I did, but sadly, we both had flights to catch. If you take anything away from this, I hope it is just how much fun it is to be curious about business and how you can learn a tremendous amount if you just keep reading about the things that interest you and talking to others. Please enjoy my great conversation with Tren Griffin.","Tren: [01:10:48] I guess, all the stuff that Bill Gates Sr did for me.

And just the mentoring time that this one man gave to me, I've written a post on what he meant to me, Bill Gates Sr lessons from. And just hours and hours of lunches and breakfasts and sessions where I was able to talk and he was able to come back and just sometimes him just listening to me.

Jason Karp,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/44480028/karp-opportunities-in-public-and-private-markets?tab=transcript,"I believe that any investment strategy that will deliver strong returns in the future must evolve. The strategy itself should rest on rock solid fundamental principles, which change rarely if ever, things like price discipline or business growth, but the features of the strategy must keep getting better because the marketplace is incredibly competitive. That evolution is the topic of today's conversation with Jason Karp. Jason is the founder and CIO of Tourbillion Capital Partners, a multi-billion dollar asset manager based in New York city. We cover a ton of interesting ground. We start with what has happened in public and private markets, discussing the role of quants, passive indexes, and value versus deep value investing. We compare the relative merits of investing in private equities and where and how opportunities arise. We then focus in on two interesting private investing trends, the health and wellness sector, and the cannabis industry.
First, we discussed Hu Kitchen and Hu Products, the food business that Jason started with his family several years ago in response to personal health challenges. Second, we discussed his evolved views on cannabis as an investment space and why it may also represent a massive growth opportunity. You all know that I value transparency, so it's important to note that since I recorded the conversation, my family became an investor in Hu products. It's been a fascinating means to learn about the food, health and wellness industry, which has grown so rapidly in recent years. We were customers of Hu in New York city, long before I even knew Jason, which made that part of the conversation, especially interesting for me. This episode reinforced my belief in pushing one's investment strategy to adapt to changing market conditions and competitive pressures. If we have any hope of beating Vanguard, we can't ever rest on our laurels. This was an especially eclectic and fun conversation, I hope you enjoy my chat with Jason Karp.","Jason: [01:09:31] Oh, this is a good one. I've had a lot of people be kind to me. This was both kind and impactful on me. When I was a freshman in college at Penn, I was meant to play tennis in college. And I had actually switched when I got to Penn because I was very burnt out in tennis, I switched to squash. And I was a walk-on onto the team, was a very good team, very competitive. And I went up to the coach and I said, this was in the third week or fourth week of school, ""Listen, I'm a very good tennis player. I've never played squash. I'll work harder than anyone. Please let me on the team."" He let me on the team. And then about a month and a half later and I was the worst on the team, I was 20th out of 20. And he really did me a favor.And about a month and a half later, I had decided to transfer from pre-med into The Wharton school. And The Wharton School had a much stricter criteria for the curriculum than the College of Arts and Sciences did. And I was very nervous that I wouldn't be able to be a college athlete and keep up with my Wharton curriculum. And so I went into the coach, it was about a month and a half later after I had joined the team. And I said, ""Listen, I just got into Wharton. I'm not going to have time to play this new sport. And I'm quitting."" And he sat me down and he had almost like a father figure. And he said, ""Jason, I see a lot of talent in you."" And up until that point, I was an underachiever in my life. And he was one of the first people who really saw what I think I could have become in terms of a person.And he said, ""I think if you stick with this sport, you'll become excellent. I think you'll love it. I think it will actually help you in school."" And after about a half hour of this, and I'm paraphrasing because it was a longer conversation, I said, ""Okay, I'll give it a shot."" And I was very insecure about this decision, and it ultimately changed my life because being a college athlete while trying to be a rigorous, a very good student at what was one of the hardest schools in the country, it taught me some great skills about perseverance, about organizational skills. Many of my friends who were recruited to be athletes, they stopped being athletes in college so they could have more fun. I don't think I had a particularly fun college experience, but it taught me some lessons that I viewed as so essential for who I am as a person.And I regard him as one of the most important mentors in my life still to this day. And that decision to be so kind as to, instead of just saying, because he didn't need me, he didn't need, I was 20th out of 20. I was the worst player on the team. He didn't need to talk me into this. I ended up being, finishing number three on the team, and being an academic all-American because I persevered through it and because of him. And it really made me who I am. So I would say that was the kindest thing someone has done for me.",Coach,,,Mentorship,his coach didn't let him quit,
Chris Douvos,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/10774725/douvos-a-value-investor-lost-in-the-valley?tab=transcript,"My guest this week is Chris Douvos, a managing partner at Venture Investment Associates, which allocates $1.6 billion on behalf of investors. Chris is the first professional allocator I've spoken with who focuses specifically on venture capital funds, so I had a ton of questions for him on how to build a portfolio in an asset class known for uncertain but often enormous outcomes.
We discuss the major recent changes in the asset class and where things might be going. I sought Chris out because while this is an investment style that is full of creativity and hope, I've always felt it could use a healthy dose of skepticism and a value investor's mindset. He delivers in spades as we try to separate the real from the ideal. We didn't record it, but Chris's tour of Palo Alto was one of the most interesting and entertaining hours I've spent. He's a student of markets and of history, and I look forward to learning more from him in the future. Please enjoy our conversation on venture capital investing.","Chris: [01:01:51] This is actually a really awesome thing, and I can't really thank anybody. I grew up really poor. My dad was a cab driver and my mom worked in a hotel. I was in Brooklyn back before Brooklyn was cool. Actually, there's a little story here. There was a guy named Jim Ventre who came... He was a young admissions officer at a school called Phillips Academy Andover, and Jim's job was to go out and find students from inner cities to pluck out. If your scores were above a certain thing and your family income was below a certain threshold, your application would be subsidized, and you'd go to school for free.Jim stood up there, and there was a near-riot. Food fight and spitball in the auditorium, the all-school auditorium, while he put up these slides. I was like, ""Oh my gosh, this is the most amazing place. Amazing pictures."" I got home and I told my dad about it, and my dad said, ""My son, in America, there is a system, and this place sounds like your entrée to the system. I want you to apply. I will miss you, but go and become part of America."" And I was like, ""Oh my gosh.""I applied and got in as a 14-year-old and went up to Andover as a freshman and went looking for Jim Ventre, and he was gone. He'd gone to law school. I was like, ""I never got to say thank you to Jim Ventre."" And by the way, the program's called the Rockwell Scholars Program. It was funded by Mr. Rockwell of Rockwell Aerospace. I never got to say thank you.Fast forward 25 years, there was an event for admitted students at the Olympic Club. I get a call from the Major Gifts Office. They're like, ""Look, we know you live in a good zip code, but we're not calling for a gift just yet, but we want-"" Chris: [01:03:30] Patience, yeah. They're patient folks. They're like, ""Look, we want to put you on the masthead of sponsors, and all we're asking is that you show up and talk about your experience for some of these admitted students."" It's me and Peter Currie and these people. I'm like, ""Holy smokes. I'm such an impostor here.""

And I show up, and the guy handing out name tags, I look at his name tag, it says James Ventre, assistant director of admissions. I'm like, ""What?"" I'm like, ""Jim Ventre?"" He goes, ""Yeah."" I'm like, ""Were you here?"" He goes, ""Yeah, I had a 20-year career in the law, but decided that my true love was admissions."" I go, ""Oh, why is that?"" He goes, ""Well, because I love the idea of changing people's lives. I love the idea of really making an impact.""

I'm like, ""Well, have I got a story for you. The last time I saw you was 25 years ago at a middle school in Brooklyn in the middle of a near-riot, and you convinced me to apply. I never saw you when I went up for my interview, I went looking for you when I arrived to say thank you, and I can now say thank you 25 years later. The last time you saw me, I was a snot-nosed punk ass, and here I am, co-sponsoring an event at the Olympic Club of San Francisco with Peter Currie and all these other luminaries. I feel like, as my dad would say, that I'm part of the system, and I owe that to you and the academy.""

That's my long-winded answer. I'm sorry for belaboring it. This is why I'm such a fan of need-blind admissions, and very much the idea of America is the idea of social mobility. And I believe that creating this optionality... Even though things are constantly evolving, I do believe that, through hard work and education and pluck, you can really make a difference, which is why I like to support charities, with both money and time, that help kids from disadvantaged backgrounds rise through education.",Admissions officer,,,Unleashed ambition,Increased ambition by convincing him to apply to fancy school,
Arianna Simpson,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/1793710/simpson-the-crypto-landscape?tab=transcript,"My guest today is Arianna Simpson, who has spent her career in and around the world of technology, working at startups, Facebook, and now in venture capital as an investor focused on the world of cryptocurrencies. I met Arianna when I hosted a panel at a big investing conference in New York City, and she was one of the panelists. On the panel, I found her style to be very straightforward and compelling. It is clear that she loves to learn and that the best manifestation of her style of learning is investing in technology. In our conversation, we discussed broad trends in crypto that we haven't spent much time on before. Decentralized versus centralized exchanges, privacy coins, and evaluating a founder or early team. We build a framework for learning about this new asset class, discuss the importance of travel, and the value of pushing oneself outside of comfort zones.
I wonder if we could on the fly almost build a framework for someone out there that's interested in building their own investment philosophy within crypto. Because you've done this through a lot of different means. We've talked a lot about your knowledge formation, and how you've learned in the space. The question that I probably get the most often is, ""It's just too daunting and intimidating, and I just don't know what to do. So I'm just not going to do anything."" So if you were doing a workshop on a build your own investment thesis or build your own investment philosophy specifically within this asset class, what would be the stages of that process?","Arianna: [00:49:05] That would probably be my parents moving from Italy to the United States. I was 17 and I graduated early from high school and I said, ""Okay, I'm off to America for college. See you later. Bye."" And they were like, ""You literally can't even sign your own medical paperwork. What are you doing?"" And they decided to pretty much drop everything and move to the U.S. to be with me for the first year, and then decide to see how it went. And ultimately, I think that was very, very generous and selfless on their part. So that would probably be the winner.",Parents,,Family,Immigration,,
"Thatcher Bell, Taylor Greene, Brett Maloley",https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/18125849/maloley-shark-tank-with-thatcher-bell-and-taylor-greene?tab=transcript,"We've always found that even in public equities, you learn more once you have a live portfolio. One of the best ways to learn is to put some capital at risk. To learn more about the venture capital world, for example, I made an investment in a startup called Ladder, a platform business that connects coaches, fitness trainers to begin with, with consumers who want or need a coach to help them improve their fitness and their health. The idea is by making the entire coaching system more efficient, Ladder can provide consumers with a real person as a coach, but at a fraction of the cost, and provide coaches with both new customers and a much better way of managing their existing business. If you're interested in the backstory of this business, you can listen to episode number 60, the podcast with founder Brett Maloley, and his story of the vision for Ladder.
We are now six months into the launch of the business, with thousands of users and coaches on the platform and run-rate revenue past a million dollars. What I was most curious about at this stage, aside from building something useful of course, was the relationship between a startup and institutional venture capitalists who are allocating capital from their funds into startups at various stages. For this episode, I asked two VCs to sit down with me and Brett and treat the conversation as they would a normal pitch meeting so that we, the audience, can get a peek into their world and the types of questions that they ask.",Question not found,,,,,,

If you liked those two conversations, you'll love this one, it is somehow even more wide ranging than the first two.
Nikhil is the CEO of CoVenture Crypto, but he ended up there because of an overarching investing style that he calls moonshot investing, which we explore right from the start and in great detail. He is obsessed with productivity and happiness. And we spent a long time on those two topics. One of the most interesting experiments I've heard about on the podcast is his Happiness project, for which he interviewed more than 100 of the wealthiest people in the world. The lessons he gleaned from those conversations are very helpful and I won't soon forget the lesson related to sacrifice.","Nikhil: [01:21:02] The kindest thing, my wife for marrying me, is the answer that I have to give and it is the most honest answer.

Excuse the lack of clear audio quality on some of the audience questions. The ones that are a little difficult to hear are fairly short, and I felt it was better to include them for some context.

But if you'd asked me to guess before looking those up, I'd have guessed that he studied philosophy because of how widely he has thought about the world and the impact of technology. Our conversation is about how technology is changing the world from an industrial age to a knowledge age. We explore how cryptocurrencies, low-cost computing, and regulation will impact our future, and why the transition may require delicate care. I love this conversation because of my obsession with the concept of scarcity. We explore what has been scarce through time and what may be scarce in the future.

He's preferred to keep a bit of a low profile but I'm hoping for everyone's sake to change that a little bit. See the show notes for where you can read him and follow him. Savneet has invested in unique things like Spanish real estate, famous startups like Uber, cryptocurrencies before they were cool and even websites. He founded and built a FinTech company.
Now, he is both a partner at the wide-ranging investment firm CoVenture with my previous guests, Ali Hamed and the co-founder of Tera Holdings, which is trying to become the Berkshire Hathaway of software companies.

There's one story that just popped in my head that was I think one of the things that I'll always remember. I don't know if it's the kindest. That was my mom passed away in 2008. It had massive impact on all of us. We were way too young. We'd gone through a lot of trauma before that. There was a family friend of ours who we're always close with but we'd never spent lots of time together. I remember it was six months later or a year later and they invited our family over for the weekend. They had three amazing little kids who were lots of fun running around the house, playing games. It was the first weekend that we, as a family had fun since my mom passed away. It was totally unexpected. This wasn't a family we'd ever been to their house before. We always loved them.

I think that instilled a lifelong love of learning in me and I'm sure it was boring for my mother to read book after book after book.

Pat ran equity research at Morningstar before leaving to start his own asset management company, Dorsey Asset Management. His areas of deep interest are competitive advantage and capital allocation. He believes that capital allocation should be in service of a competitive advantage and invest in a concentrated portfolio that he and his team feel embodied these ideas. If you've not already, I strongly recommend listening to our first conversation first, which is a crash course on moats. In this conversation, we cover different ground. We spend much more time on individual stocks like Facebook, Google, and Chegg, using them as examples to explore Pat's investment philosophy and strategy. Across a few conversations with Pat, I can tell he is in love with this stuff. And I always enjoy talking to investors like him, who's so passionately pursue an edge. Please enjoy round two with Pat Dorsey.
At the first time that we spoke, we did a 45 minute crash course on all things, moats and capital allocation. We'll touch on some of those ideas as we talk about some businesses today, but we'll explore a couple of other different topics first. And I think a fun place to start would be your framework for valuation. So obviously you're looking for companies that have moats, hopefully run by people that are good capital allocators, but at the end of the day, even if you had those two things or it could be a price at which it didn't make any sense to buy the business. So in your third-quarter letter, this past year, you did a deep write-up on how you think about valuing a business.

Most of us have never traveled to the far East or Eastern Europe, where many of the thousands of emerging market public equities operate. I've been very lucky to travel quite a bit in Asia and the Middle East, but never to Eastern Europe, which is where Firebird focuses its investments.
Harvey and I discuss his 24 years of experience evaluating emerging and frontier market countries, industries, and individual stocks. We discuss his experience buying privatization vouchers in Russia, banks in the Baltics and how today's emerging market opportunity-set compares to the past. Like so many of these conversations with investors who have earned significant excess returns, it's clear investing opportunities in emerging markets are often disguised. Finding them requires risk, hard work, discipline, and a dose of luck and timing. Please enjoy my conversation with Harvey on emerging market opportunities.","Harvey: [00:57:56] Other than a family member, I don't know. I think that I would give a shout out to my old law firm, Wachtell Lipton. They worked me very hard, but they always treated their associates like real important people and they compensated us fairly. And then when I left, they were extremely nice to me. I then went on to write a novel, which was published in 1995, which was about of a law firm that some said was like Wachtell Lipton. And it wasn't a particularly favorable portrayal of the legal profession, I have to say. Marty Lipton wrote me a note saying how much he liked the novel. And I thought that was just a class move. He's really somebody who stands out to me as class act.",Boss,,,Took the high road,he wrote a mean novel about his former coworker and they were nice to him,
Anthony Pompliano,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/39901761/pompliano-full-tilt-investing?tab=transcript,"My guest this week is Anthony Pompliano. Pomp began his career in the military and has since been a successful entrepreneur, worked as a head of growth at Facebook, and started Full Tilt Capital, an early-stage investing firm in North Carolina. This conversation has three memorable sections. Early on, we discuss the four traits that Pomp looks for in founders, which we cover in detail. These double as traits that are important when hiring anyone. Next, we discuss his unique take on cryptocurrencies, where he is excited about the prospects for tokenized securities. Finally, we explore a unique media company, Barstool Sports, and what makes it such a powerful brand. Please enjoy our somewhat abbreviated discussion, and know that we will continue the conversation soon.","Anthony: [00:40:38] It's probably my parents. I grew up in a house, so I'm the oldest of five boys. My dad traveled a lot when I was younger. My mom's a saint, obviously. We're all alive, all have our arms and legs. But I remember many times as a kid where they would do things for us that didn't cost any money, but they would take us somewhere, or they would just spend time with us or do things where now looking back, there is zero chance that they were still happy and sane and calm and all that stuff, but they knew it was important. I think those are the memories probably from growing up that mean the most to me. It was probably at the times where my parents least wanted to do that. To me, that's the ultimate definition of kindness. It's somebody who doesn't need to do something, probably doesn't even want to do it, but they do it anyways for the betterment of somebody else or the enjoyment somebody else. I think that's probably what it is. I'm so grateful for them having done that. I don't get to see my brothers as much, I don't get to see my family as much, but we have those memories. And so I think that's probably what it is, which it's nice to not have to go that far to find that.",Parents,,Family,Sacrifice,,
Ben Hunt,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/28172588/hunt-the-three-body-portfolio?tab=transcript,"My guest this week is Dr. Ben Hunt, the Chief Investment Strategist at Salient and the author of the extremely popular website, The Epsilon Theory. I've always enjoyed Ben's writing style, particularly his use of farm and animal-based analogies to describe market phenomenon. In this conversation, we discuss his recent post, The Three-Body Problem, why growth has been beating value, and why a strategy that he calls profound agnosticism, a sort of take on risk parity, may be the most appropriate investment strategy in what he views as a very uncertain world. Please enjoy our conversation.","Ben: [01:05:09] There are kind of easy answers like when my wife said yes. That was very kind of her. I can also think of things like the tough love kindnesses. But, frankly, I've had these ... I think we've all lived with these situations in both business and in our personal lives. Again, there are a couple of these moments. The kindest moments, the most human moments, are when you are forgiven. Those are very special and very human, and it's important, I think, to remember in our actions towards others, that that's the greatest grace we can give, is to forgive.",,,,Forgiveness,,
Preston Byrne,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/43605350/byrne-cryptopocalypse?tab=transcript,"My guest this week is Preston Byrne. Preston is a vocal critic of the crazy prices and projects in the world of cryptocurrencies. His background is in the legal world and also as a founder and former CEO of Monax, which made the first open source permissioned blockchain client. As Preston says, he is a blockchain without Bitcoin guy who believes that this crypto mania will end in some sort of apocalypse for token holders and Ico issuers.
We tackle several issues from his broad skepticism of crypto assets to the potential regulatory reaction from major governments to types of coins like Stablecoins, which Preston views as analogous to perpetual motion machines.","Preston: [01:08:27] Kindness thing anyone's done or said for me was a friend of mine in New York City. When I left Monax earlier in the summer of 2017, a buddy of mine was like, I was a bit disappointed about the circumstances of my departure. And one person who knows who he is, kind of shook me out of it and was like, ""Dude, get it together, get writing again."" And this is before I hadn't blogged anything. And you can tell when I'm in a bad mood, because I haven't written anything in six months.And so he's like, ""Dude, get it together, whatever."" And we went up to Pork Fest in New Hampshire, which is a libertarian sort of anarchist festival and had a great time. And I would say that person is the one who, that shaking me out of my... Getting me back to my senses, that's the nicest thing anyone's done for me in the space.",Friend,,,Critique,,
Ali Hamed,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/75736723/hamed-creative-investing?tab=transcript,"I have a special request this week, which is to share this episode with every curious person in your life. The conversation with the 26-year-old investor named Ali Hamed serves as an example of what's possible when you think creatively. Ali views the world with a fresh set of eyes and has already become an expert at identifying new investment opportunities where others have not. As the second prodigy, 26-year-old in his many weeks on the podcast, these young guns are making me feel like an ancient 32-year-old. We talk about alpha in our world, earning returns better than the market. But the keyword in that last sentence isn't alpha, it's earning. Hopefully you, like me, will use this conversation as a reminder of what it takes to earn differentiated returns. It's not just the hard work, but also the mindset. We explore many examples of how to create new investment opportunities, from rolling out the Instagram accounts, to financing perishable fruit like watermelons, to heavy machinery software. Please enjoy this special conversation with Ali Hamed. Follow him and his partners and then go figure out how to earn success yourself in whatever it is you do by helping others solve problems with empathy.
So, Ali, I'm going to start with a question that, as I'm thinking about it, I don't think I've ever actually asked anyone on this podcast, which is for you to describe your investment philosophy overall.","Ali: [00:34:32] Every single day I am exposed to more risk because my opportunity cost grows more. So on day null, there's less risk because you have almost no opportunity cost. I didn't have a fund, so my worst-case scenario is I didn't have funds the next day. So I can take some amount of risk. By the way, when you're underwriting a manager, you should try to figure out how much personal risk they have. And one way people do that, it's, oh, how much is the GP committed to the fund? I hope it's one, to two, to three percent of the fund. That's part of it, but it's also how much do they have to lose from their reputation? So, I would say we've now built a firm where, look, we've made money for people. The returns I think have been good enough where we're having people stay with us and grow with us. So every day thereafter, we have greater risk and I personally have greater risk because I'm getting more and more to lose. I think that's actually a competitive advantage to newer entrants. It's just like when a large company won't go into a new space because they have more to lose. Microsoft can't just suddenly embrace the Blockchain because they have a business that they might hinder. That allows a start-up with nothing to lose to go after it. The larger the start-up becomes, all of a sudden becomes a big company, now they have a lot to lose. So, I would say that later today I'll be incurring more risks than I will right now, and tomorrow more risks than today.",,,,,,

His most recent stint was as the co-head of the seed investing business at NEA, the largest venture capital firm in the worlds, where Sheel was also a partner. Now Sheel has set off on his own, setting up his own firm called Amplo and having recently raised $100 million venture fund where he is the sole general partner. He aims to invest with young, mission-driven entrepreneurs with a global focus. As you can tell from this resume which also includes a degree from Stanford and a law degree from Harvard, this is one ambition guy. There are several aspects of this conversation that will really stick with me, specifically his points on networking and the smartest decision he's seen entrepreneurs make. I also loved our discussion of some of the same trends we explored last week with Chris Dixon, topics like drones, automated cars, and blockchain, where Sheel often has different takes than the consensus.

Chris is a prolific investor and thinker, having been an entrepreneur, angel investor, and now partner at the well-known venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Our conversation focuses on major trends in technology including cryptocurrencies and the future of autonomous vehicles and drones. Chris has a rule of thumb for technology trends. ""Find out what smart people are working on during the weekends and you'll know what others will be doing years down the road."" After surveying his old essays, it's clear you could use Chris' writings as a similar litmus test.

"Jim Higgins, Tom Digan, Joel Jasinski, Rick Murray",https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/92300428/higgins-retail-contrarians?tab=transcript,"So, far I've spent no time in this podcast discussing real estate, so I was excited to get the chance to talk to the team at Sorin Capital, a billion-dollar hedge fund which specializes in commercial real estate, REITs, and commercial mortgage backed securities. Sorin is led by Jim Higgins who founded the firm and Tom Digan, who coincidentally was a college classmate of mine at Notre Dame. This conversation has two angles. The first which starts about 20 minutes into our talk after we introduce the sector and the opportunity set, is a deep dive into a specific trade, a fairly contrarian take on the retail industry, specifically comparing different types of retail real estate.
As you'll hear the dispersion of mispricing in the sector may be huge, creating opportunities for specialists to earn real alpha by doing bottom up work. The second angle we explore is what I believe to be a strong model for the future of asset management businesses, that is tailoring products, strategies, and even specific trades to the needs and risk return profiles the clients want and need, instead of just selling a one size fits all commingled fund. You probably heard me joke that this podcast should be called this is who you're up against, and this episode is a good example of why. I always enjoy exploring a niche part of the market, and this conversation on real estate is a perfect example of the type of work that firms do on behalf of their clients.

Franklin Foer,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/87203387/foer-world-without-mind?tab=transcript,"My guest this week is Franklin Foer, the author of the recently published book World Without Mind. The topic of our conversation is one that I've been thinking through often this past year: the impact that large tech companies have on our minds and on our behavior. This conversation is only indirectly related to markets, but given that the companies we discuss are now several of the largest companies by market cap in the global stock market what happens to them likely impacts all of our portfolios whether we own them or not. Given that these companies compete for our attention and dollars, they also affect our businesses. As an example, my friend Brent Beshore and his team at Ad Ventures recently wrote a long and incredibly thoughtful piece on how they think about Amazon as a force in the market and how they plan on navigating around such a fierce competitor. Franklin's book, especially the early history, is very thought-provoking, so it is no surprise that our conversation was too. Please enjoy our talk on the modern tech giants.","Franklin: [00:54:48] I've been lucky to have friends who... Every life has its share of crises and I think the extent to which your friends kind of are selfless in the face of crises is always... When you're in the middle of a crises you feel alone. You get into this moment of existential fear and this sense that, you screw up at work and you're going to lose your job and lose your livelihood. Your brain starts to make all these connections about the worst that can happen. When you have friends who are able, in that moment of crisis, to come in and behave selflessly to you, that's the most extraordinary thing.I had one crisis at work when I was an editor and we published a series of articles that were alleged to have been fabricated by an author. It was an author who was a solider in Iraq and said to have embellished them. It was in the middle of the Iraq War and advertisers were coming down hard on us and it felt like everything was going to go to shit. I had a friend who was actually worked with me and he was taking over another job. He spent a week just kind of helping me, on his own, going full time, crazy long days trying to help me get through this crisis where he just kind of embedded with me. It was such a beautiful act of friendship.",Friend,,,Help in time of need,,

Before shifting his career to focus solely on crypto, Adam was a venture capitalist focused on FinTech which is how he came across the Bitcoin white paper earlier than most. I call this episode a sober view on crypto because Adam's take is so balanced. He is certainly long crypto both in his portfolio and career, but he is very skeptical of much of what is happening today in the ecosystem. For example, He offers the best reason that I've heard for not launching an ICO or investing in them. If you haven't read Adam's widely shared open letter to Jamie Diamond, it has become a must-read piece for crypto enthusiasts, read it as soon as you can.","Adam: [01:04:31] Wow. I would say... Wow, that is amazing, I wish I had prepared, but I guess it's better I haven't. My mind immediately went to all the mentors I've had in my life who just helped me at different stages, which they didn't need to do, to teach me something or to help me meet someone that landed me a job or that landed me somewhere. But I actually think I have to go all the way back to my parents and say my parents just telling me, you've got to follow wherever your curiosity takes you and just do your best and we'll be proud of you, and that's all we want from you.""

Connor Leonard,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/11959619/leonard-capital-light-compounders-reinvestment-moats?tab=transcript,"This week's conversation is an ode to old school, fundamental public market investing. My conversation is with IMC's Connor Leonard who spends most of his waking hours thinking and reading about markets. His mandate is to invest purely as if it was his own money, with no pressure to hug a benchmark and no pressure to do much of anything other than earn strong, long-term returns. The portfolio that results from this approach is highly concentrated and unique. Connor's strategy is to sort companies into four categories based on their type of sustainable competitive advantage. As you'll hear the vast majority fall into the first category, which means they have no such advantage and therefore should be largely set aside. We spend the majority of our conversation talking about the other three categories; one, companies with a legacy moat; two, companies with a reinvestment moat; and, three, an interesting category that Connor calls capital-light compounders, which we explore in detail.
When you step back and think about public markets, you realize how amazing it is that we can, from afar, buy an interest in so many companies around the world. A select few go on to deliver outstanding returns. This conversation highlights how hard that can be, but also how fun and ultimately rewarding. Please enjoy my talk with Connor Leonard.","Connor: [01:01:55] I'd say, to go back to Quinton, just he's top of mind. I had this passion, I'd say borderline fanatical interest in being a public markets investor. And to be honest with you, that's not really what our business is. It's not our core business at IMC, our core business is buying private companies. That's what I've been doing for a number of years, but he saw my interest and he gave me an opportunity to do really what's my dream job inside a company with people who I respect and admire. I don't know how anybody can do something kinder than that.Now, hopefully, he thought I could actually make him some money in the process and do well for the IMC shareholders. And trust me every day, nobody wants that more than I do, not just to prove him right, but also I really believe in the IMC story and our model and I just feel fortunate to be a part of that. So my life is just so much better because my path crossed with his and he's just done so many things along the way that he didn't have to do but he was always really great at looking out for other people. And I think it made him fulfilled and that's how he lived his life. So he was a great role model.",Boss,,,Took a chance,,

As you'll hear early and often he is programmed to go his own way to, as he says, go one way when everyone else is going another. His name is Dhani Jones. A name I knew as a Notre Dame football fan because he won a championship with our arch rivals, the university of Michigan in the late 1990s. Dhani went on to a long and successful career in the NFL, but even more interesting are his many pursuits in business and investing outside of football. Like my conversation with Tim Urban, I'll remember this conversation as a reminder to use a first principles mindset. Dhani seems to have this fresh mindset baked into his character. And as you'll hear, it has led to many a great adventure. Please enjoy my conversation with athlete, businessman, investor, philanthropist, movie buff, and bow tie wearer, Dhani Jones.
Let's start with the concept of hard work, or just how you think about how hard you are working. You've got one of the most interesting histories and combination of experiences of anyone that's been on this. Maybe you could, I don't normally do introductions, but given the range of things that you've done, you could start by giving a brief kind of history or outline of some of the things you've done and we'll dive into each.","Dhani: [00:54:01] Oh, kindest thing. That's a tough question. A lot of people have been very, very kind to me. I think that Lloyd Carr was very kind to me when he gave me a scholarship to the University of Michigan. He was very kind. Now, his kindness was reflected in my mother's sternness, Nancy Jones, of saying, ""I know you don't necessarily want to give my son a scholarship, but he's got a little chip on his shoulder. And if he goes to the University of Washington, he's going to beat you guys in the Rose Bowl. So I think you maybe want to reevaluate that."" So coach Carr was very kind in giving me a scholarship. And it's kind of coincidental and synchronistic at the same time, we won the national championship against Washington State. So it may not have been the same university, but they're right around the corner from each other. And so I don't know if that's when I first started really believing in moments that are supposed to happen, but that definitely was one of them all.",Coach,,,Took a chance,,

And I think you are, at one point, were the only traditional buy-side analyst that was covering these things, trying to deal with them as you would deal with an equity.

Brad and I get deep into the history behind his company and the ways in which markets and exchanges have evolved for better and worse. We discussed latency arbitrage, why exchanges make less money on actual trading activity than you might guess, and the two most impactful meetings Brad took while setting up IEX.

Brett Maloley,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/72222362/maloley-ladder-the-fitness-marketplace?tab=transcript,"This week's episode is part of an experiment, and so requires a longer than normal introduction. I've come to view this podcast as a learning tool, a means to understand a new topic in a short window of time. One of those areas is venture capital and startups, an area that one year ago was completely foreign to me. I think the best way to learn is aggressive immersion in the topic, along with some consequences, what we often call skin in the game. Accordingly, this is a conversation with a founder of a startup in which I, personally, am an investor. I say this in full disclosure because I believe in being very transparent with you, but also because I obviously want this business to do well. Part of the reason I invested was because I thought I could personally affect the outcome, in part, by exposing the model and ideas to you all. I deeply respect your opinions and collective breadth of knowledge and welcome thoughts that you have on this startup and this topic.
The founder in this case is Brett Maloley. His company is called Ladder. Ladder represents an overlap of many topics we've explored together over the past year. We've talked about venture capital, health and wellbeing, the difficulty of fundraising, and parallel outcomes and startups. We also spent an entire episode with Alex Moazed talking about the business model that Ladder is pursuing. This is what Alex calls the platform business model and what my favorite technology writer, Ben Thompson calls the aggregator model. Alex wrote the book, Modern Monopolies about this model, which describes how companies like Uber, Airbnb, and others serve their clients. Platform companies sit at the intersection between consumers and producers in a given category helping make life easier, cheaper, and/or better for consumers and more profitable and flexible for producers.",Question not found,,,,,,

And she's just this really... And even though she's trying to figure out what to do with her life, she has her own things but she just is always there to help. So, I would say that her support, especially through Wait But Why and all the different things, and all the traveling, and all the all-nighters and the fact that I haven't had time for her during these big posts. I would put it there.",Parents,,Family,Upbringing,,
Olaf Carlson,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/45490117/ehrsam-hash-power-part-3?tab=transcript,"In episodes one and two of Hash Power, we explored blocking technology and cryptocurrency investing. In this episode, we discussed the current and potential future states of the crypto world. We cover new forms of cooperation, regulation, security and storage and why blockchains allow systems to evolve at such a rapid pace. Be sure to listen until the end where we close with some advice about conducting ourselves in a new world where creativity reigns and repetitive jobs disappear, a trend that may only accelerate thanks to blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies.",Question not found,,,,,,
"Jeremiah Lowin, Josh Seims, Ari Paul, Olaf Carlson",https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/27167205/seims-hash-power-part-2?tab=transcript,"In episode one of Hash Power, we explored blockchains as a technology, how they work, why tokens, also known as cryptocurrencies, are an integral part of any blockchain, and how these new networks might change the world. In episode two, we spend time with the leading investors in the field. Like any frenzied asset class, there are countless cryptocurrency hedge funds popping up everywhere. But founders from three of the original firms, Polychain, MetaStable, and BlockTower Capital, are our primary guides this week.
As I speak, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies is $136 billion. There are hundreds of tokens currently available, but Bitcoin and Ethereum still represent 75% of the total market. $136 billion sounds like a big number, but it's tiny relative to any other asset class. And I use that term with hesitation. To put it in perspective, that's exactly the same size as the market cap of IBM. But IBM has more than $10 billion of earnings. Tokens have none. As you will hear, valuing tokens is a very hard exercise. I said it emphatically during the introduction to episode one, but given that this is the investing episode, let me say it with even more emphasis. None of what you are about to hear is investment advice of any kind. Just as you shouldn't buy Apple stock because you love their products and hope to outperform the broad market, you shouldn't buy any cryptocurrencies without deep, personal research and consideration. A big part of my goal with this episode is to introduce you to the players who are shaping the investment ecosystem and how the investing ecosystem, with exchanges, trading, and weird custody problems, works in action. Collectively, our guests run hundreds of millions of dollars, likely now approaching a billion dollars, in pure-play cryptocurrency investment strategies. While we do explore examples of how to think about individual tokens, these are not investment recommendations. Rather, this is an introduction to the various stages of cryptocurrency investing, from early-stage white papers to full-fledged liquid tokens, and the strategies and skillsets being deployed by the pure-play investors.",Question not found,,,,,,
"Naval Ravikant, Fred Ehrsam, Charlie Noyes, Olaf Carlson",https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/39800754/lowin-hash-power-part-1?tab=transcript,"The documentary you were about to hear started with an email from Matt Goetz, the now CEO of a cryptocurrency investment firm, BlockTower Capital. Matt emailed me and invited me to lunch. He had a great job at Goldman Sachs but was leaving it to start a new hedge fund that dealt in cryptocurrencies, to which I said, ""That sounds cool. What the hell is a cryptocurrency?"" His partner, Ari Paul, was also leaving his job as a portfolio manager at the University of Chicago's endowment. Ari would be the CIO and Matt would run the business. Over the next several months, with the significant help of Matt and Ari, I had conversations with leading thinkers and creators in the field, big picture philosophers like Naval Ravikant and Fred Harrison. Creators like Juan Benet and Mooney Bali. Investors like Ari Paul and Olaf Carlson-Wee. In the coming episodes, these leaders will be your guide to understanding blockchain technology, cryptocurrency investing, and the future of markets.
Hash Power is meant to be an introduction, but really, it's an invitation to explore this emerging world on your own. As you'll see, nothing that is this early in its development is easy to understand. I hope Hash Power will serve as a litmus test for your own interest in blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Now, crucially, nothing you hear here is investment advice of any kind. Naval Ravikant and several others made a very good suggestion to me. Don't buy any cryptocurrencies unless you spent an enormous amount of time investigating them. It's important to note that as I was having these conversations, I owned virtually no cryptocurrency. I did buy small amounts so that I could watch and experience the blockchain in action. Buying, sending, receiving, converting between currencies. Things like watching transactions settle on the chain without ever being verified by a centralized entity or authority or sending money to Europe and back. You wouldn't opine on Uber by reading stories about it. You'd order a car, ride somewhere and compare your experience to that and the yellow cab.",Question not found,,,,,,
David Tisch,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/51400738/tisch-tech-investing-outside-of-silicon-valley?tab=transcript,"My guest this week is David Tisch, who was instrumental in building and fostering venture capital investing in New York City. If you liked my conversation with Jerry Neumann, who incidentally introduce me to David, you're going to love this one. David was a co-founder at TechStars, New York's answer to Silicon Valley's famous tech incubator, Y Combinator. He now runs the Box Group, a prominent seed stage venture capital firm which has looked at thousands of startups and invested in more than 200. We explore tech investing outside of Silicon Valley, the tech accelerator model, the evolution of early stage investing, and why the best companies may start coming out of non-traditional venture hubs. David does a great job of explaining how things have changed for technology startups, and why certain strategies, especially those for acquiring customers, won't work nearly as well in the future. I learned a lot during this hour, and I think you will too. Please enjoy my conversation with David Tisch.
So I thought we would begin by talking about New York City. We're sitting here right in the heart of it, right south of Union Square and one of the things that one of the main reasons I wanted to talk to you was because of your role in building up the venture capital technology investment scene in New York, away from, I guess, Silicon Valley, maybe even Boston, as more traditional centers for venture type investing. So I want to open it up there. And just have you talk about, what were your motivations? How did you go about doing that? And I want to get into kind of what makes for a rich, fertile soil for venture investing to begin with?","David: [01:06:59] The kindest thing that ever happened to me, I referenced that company from 2007 to 2009 that I worked at - I was aggressively fired from that company, with a security guard escorting me out of the door. And I was running a division at the company I had 30 people that I personally hired, that I inspired to work there. I had a fire in my belly before that but that lit me up, it hasn't dwindled in any way since and I think that it wasn't a good moment. I sat in my house depressed for a good six months after that, and that was when I was studying the accelerator model because I was just depressed and sitting there but I think without knowing it, the guy who fired me did the kindest thing anybody could have done for me.",Boss,,,Critique,firing=critique,
David Gardner,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/36536188/gardner-finding-companies-that-break-the-rules?tab=transcript,"The investment strategy discussed in this week's episode is diametrically opposed to my own value tendencies, but it is still one that has done exceptionally well. My guest is David Gardner, co founder of The Motley Fool. He's unique in that he's both a pure investor, a true stock junky, and an entrepreneur. His energy is remarkable. His positive vibes are really something to behold. You'll hear it over audio but it's even more palpable in person. Our conversation is about finding companies which are breaking rules in the right way and reshaping industries. David's goal is to find these companies early in and hold them forever. If you love investing, you are going to love this regardless of your prior beliefs. Please enjoy my talk with David Gardner on rule breakers.
The experiments I'll call them that you've run in your podcast, sort of things that you keep returning to, themes across the episodes, which of those has been the most surprising to the upside? What's the one that you've enjoyed the most?","David: [01:14:43] I would probably say just that my father invested for me because it's lead to everything else that I've been able to do. So he was not an investor professionally himself. He was a lawyer. His dad had invested in the stock market, and he did. And he did very successfully. The Washington Post company. I grew up in Washington DC, that's where Tom and I were from, was a tremendous stock. He held it for a few decades. Warren Buffett was on the board. The Grand Family was a great company, and it was our hometown newspaper. But dad took the time to save money, a hard trick for many people, many Americans that do. And to forego spending that on something that he would've enjoyed and put it into a kid who is just born into his account and added to it over the course of years. And then didn't just build that, he then taught it and sat me down. While the other kids were playing whiffle ball, we're there going over Value Line and learning what a net profit margin is, which is a really great thing to know.So kind, it's a beautiful word. It can mean many things. So maybe I can even think of better answers, but when I think of the effort that he made and how profound that was in my life and then how I've tried to magnify that through starting a company and then reaching as many people as we can about the stock market, I have to think of that as my knee jerk.",Father,,Family,Mentorship,also upbringing,
Meb Faber,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/7797361/faber-factors-dividends-and-angel-investing?tab=transcript,"My guest this week is Meb Faber, who started the podcast similar to this one right before mine and was a big reason I was open to the idea in the first place. Meb is a quantitative research whose firm Cambria has been behind many interesting investment strategies that break the Wall Street mold. We talk about investing factors, dividends, angel investing, podcasts and more. This was a fun catch up with a close friend in the industry who has been a leader in using data to explore the best potential active strategies in a variety of different asset classes. Please enjoy our conversation, which begins with a factor draft.","Meb: [00:47:29] I'm going to answer this trying to be a little surprised by it. I actually talked about this in my last one, and it kind of came to me as we were talking about something else. And I said, I'm going to give you two. One personal and one career.Career was when I was in my mid-20's and had written this first paper, I sent it off to a dozen people. And all names you would know. Kind of famous investors. Half never responded. Another three were like, ""Dude, I don't have time for you. Why are you sending me this?"" Or, ""Market timing's impossible."" I got like, three really nasty responses. And we're not going to name names, but if you search my blog, you'd probably find them. But really, just cruel, mean. Being like, ""This research is worthless. You're an idiot."" From some very, just respected names. Anyway, but Rob Bernat, who manages at this point, like $200 billion, was like, ""Hey Meb, this is a great piece. It's like a C+ paper. The idea is sound, but you need to write it in the format that will get it into Financial Analyst Journal, or something like that."" And it was very harsh criticism, but it was very thoughtful. And the fact that he took the time to answer. So I've tried to answer every single email that people have sent me over the past 10 years. And they may be short and very two sentences, spellings, and grammatical errors, but I try to respond to all of them because to me, that meant the world at the time. Now, oddly enough, the kindest thing of those guys that they probably did to me was the guy that sent the really horrific email, because that incentivized me to kind of F-U and try to write a great paper and build a good business.On the personal side, and this is the one that came up in the last podcast with Jason. I said you know, growing up, my parents, middle-class family, my dad grew up on a farm. No running water type of set up in Colorado. And so growing up, like a normal middle-class family. And they said, ""Meb, look. Anything that you want to read, we're not going to go buy you the new Nintendo robot. But any book, or anything you ever want to read, we'll pay for."" So then I just took that and ran with it. And I think the next week subscribed to about 30 different comic book subscriptions. So they started showing up in droves a week later. And then my poor mom. But they were kind of like, ""Hey, that's well played, Meb. You can read these, and that's fine."" So I learned how to read, growing up reading Marvel and DC and everything. So my mom, at this point, bless her soul, she's even kept them. It's got to be 5, 10,000 comics somewhere in her basement, sitting somewhere. They're probably not worth that much, because it was later. I guess that was 80's and 90's comics. But to me, that was something that, it meant a lot, had the right intentions.",Mentor,,,Critique,,

Several years ago he left Morningstar to form his own asset management firm, Dorsey Asset Management, and build a portfolio of companies with wide moats like those he studied at Morningstar.

Because of the rise of quants, many are asking themselves how to survive and thrive in this changing industry. In short, how can traditional managers compete with quants?
This second conversation with Leigh was set up to answer many of the questions posed in the first one. If quants are taking over, what should other investors do about it?

Lots of you will already be familiar with Wes Gray, and those of you who are not are in for a treat. Wes is the founder of Alpha Architect, a firm that manages quantitative equity strategies for clients using factors like value and momentum. He also advocates a more concentrated, pure approach to factor investing, which listeners know is music to my ears. While we share a lot of the same views on markets and investing, you will still find this refreshing. The conversation was easy to structure. I just took all the questions clients and prospective investors always ask of me and my firm and turned them on Wes. These range from very specific questions on quant investing to big existential ones. I listened to this on a long drive home and laughed out loud in the car at least five times. You are going to love it all.
Talk about the mindset that gets beat into you or brainwashed into you as a Marine. I’ve read a lot about Belleau Wood and Devil Dogs and sort of the mindset underneath it all. Compare that maybe to the rest of some other branches of the service and kind of how the mindset is or isn't an advantage if you think it. I don't assume you think it is.","Wes: [01:17:24] I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the standards. My mom and my parents obviously, did good but that's cheesy because everyone says that even though it's true. My wife, for dealing with me and having my three kids. Those are all the standards. I might have two, another military one but again, it's going to sound weird. Unfortunately, again, it’s going to go back to IOC, Infantry Officer Course.We had this guy that I’ll never forget and Captain Rettinger. He was the captain in charge of running IOC. At the time, this is serious because people are getting pulled out of IOC to go in-country combat so it was like a pretty hard-core time. This guy was like the hardest, meanest, biggest asshole on the planet. You're like just a straight-up not… I want to call it hazex. Everything in the end I realized, after the fact, was there for a reason. He was totally insane as far as like his warrior, monk-like just, “We’re going to dement you.” It's almost like, “You guys are like Vikings.” That was his mentality but we’re all still kind of like living in the 21st century. His harshness which at the time because I was a total buyer on that, I personally was like into it and I hated it at the same time. The reason I say it was the kindest thing is because I really felt he made us so freaking hard and so intense that when you actually did the real thing, you never had even breached in the system one. I was always insistent too even in combat zones like whatever. We’re just doing SOPs. I’d say it’s the kindest thing because I just feel like that's a good reason why not just me, but I think a lot of Marines that went through that platoon training with that guy are alive today because he actually kicked our ass so hard that it was actually ironically like a really kind thing. He wasn’t trying to be your friend. He was trying to, we learned the aftereffect, make you really good at your job. I just thought that was really nice of the guy, to be honest for kicking my ass which is a weird, nice thing.",Military trainer,,,Training,,
Rishi Ganti,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/4912487/ganti-esoteric-assets?tab=transcript,"My guest this week is Rishi Ganti, whose resume is bonkers. I'm not sure what to do, other than laugh in amazement at his professional credentials. Ph.D. in economics, CFA, CPA, lawyer, speaks six languages, and so on. The best part is, he isn't lording these credentials over anyone. In fact, casts some shade on the whole idea of credentials in our conversation. He just did it all because he's a learning fiend. Rishi's core idea about markets is this: avoid markets at all costs. As he explains off the bat, the minute there are multiple buyers for anything, prices get efficient very quickly. Therefore, the opportunity to find alpha shrinks. Instead, he searches for what he calls esoteric assets, things without a market, orphaned assets that require high human capital and human touch. We explore several interesting examples from charter school financing to factoring receivables for the Vatican. A stark realization I had during the episode is how big the world's asset base is. Almost all of our attention goes to the most highly refined ones, stocks, and bonds, but there is a whole other world out there we explore in great detail. The closing sections of this conversation on what Rishi would do if not investing, and his answer for the kindest thing that anyone has done for him, were among the best answers that I've heard. Please enjoy this great conversation with Rishi Ganti.","Rishi: [01:14:45] For me, I'm actually suspect in even guessing what the kindest thing would have been. There are so many. I may not even realize it, which sounds sad. Actually, one moment does come to mind as perhaps the kindest thing that was ever done to me, because it actually taught me what kindness was. I grew up with parents that were very unreliable. That's just a fact of my life. My friends like to joke that pretty much explains everything in my adult life. When we moved from the south suburbs of Chicago into a solidly middle-class suburb at Wheeling, Illinois, this is a place where all the roads are twisty and windy and have cul-de-sacs because it's residential. I'd never seen that, coming out of a city. Of course, I was left to fend for myself whether I was going to school or not, or where the bus was. I had no idea as I walked out the door what even to do. That was my existence. My mom told me, ""Well, you've got to get yourself to school,"" or whatever. I remember just crying, because I didn't want to be one of those kids. One of those delinquent kids that we had in Chicago, who didn't show up to school on purpose. I actually cared very much about school. It was a refuge for me, and it was a great place to learn. I was crying among all these townhouses or whatever, and curvy streets that just led to nowhere. I didn't know what to do. I just looked through tear-filled eyes at a house, with a very nice car, by the way. For a lower-middle-class suburb, this house had a sports car. I knocked on the door, and I couldn't have been intelligible. I was bawling. I asked the lady who appeared, ""Will you please drive me to school?"" She said, ""Sure,"" and she did. When you're really young, it's hard to think abstractly about things. You don't really know what honesty is, or courage, or anything. But at that moment, I really knew what kindness was, and a little bit more about what I had to be as a person.",Neighbor,,,Help in time of need,,
Jerry Neumann,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/58980708/neumann-the-deployment-age-power-laws-and-venture-capital?tab=transcript,"I am drawn to a group of investors that I call practitioner philosophers. These are people who have gotten their hands dirty in their respective fields, but despite being doers, they still often sit back and ponder the big questions. My guest this week is one such practitioner philosopher, New York City-based venture capitalist Jerry Neumann. I came across Jerry's essays a year ago. And he is on a very short list of writers whose work I read without fail and almost always more than once. You can think about this conversation on business investing and venture capital as a big funnel, we start very broadly discussing where we might be in a large 70-year economic cycle. We then break down the so-called power law, which seems to govern venture capital returns and business outcomes, then we get even more specific discussing Jerry's process for evaluating early-stage companies and the particulars of what might make a good venture capitalist. I say might, because as Jerry explains often, nothing is certain and luck may always play a huge role. I just love this conversation.
It is the type that without the podcast as an excuse, would be a very odd and intense one if I were just meeting Jerry, for the first time. You'll find no small talk or even medium talk here. This is a meaty discussion with one of the smartest and most straightforward people I've come across. Let's dive in.","Jerry: [01:26:07] How can anybody not say something about their parents, right? But here's the kindest thing anybody has ever done for me in reality. This is maybe... I should probably say something more interesting. But when I was a kid, my parents thought I was bored. And I was bored. I get bored easily. And they said... I must have been 13. ""You know what? We're going to buy you a computer."" And they bought me a TRS-80, which at the time was incredibly expensive. It was $800 and that that day's money, which is probably several thousand dollars now. Nobody had computers. So them saying, ""We're actually going to... We don't know much about computers, he seems to think they're interesting, he's bored, he seems smart, let's buy him something that'll keep him occupied."" They bought me a computer and two years later I was programming professionally, I went to college to learn how to build computers. I built a smaller computer, not a full-fledged TRS-80, but I built my own computer when I was 16. Really, that was the beginning of this career that has made me successful. And I think it's one of those things where one of my kids walked to me and said, ""Hey, I need a $5,000 thing, that seems kind of cool. Can you do that?"" I think my parents made a bet on me. That was a good bet, but there's no way to know that at the time. That's got to be probably the... I don't know if kind is the right word, but-",Parents,,,Gift,Bought him a computer,

So today I will give you my version. I won't do this often, and I only do it this week in case listenership drops due to the holiday. I didn't want any guest to have a smaller than normal audience. I've now been doing this for almost one year and have learned a tremendous amount. Since the whole idea behind the show is to learn in public, I'm going to share a few of the lessons I've learned with you today. I'll shape it as a top 10 list, which ends with a fun story about my recent dinner with Warren Buffett. You'll notice that many of these are just good business and life lessons applied to something specific. In this case, a podcast.

Scott Norton,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/80473072/norton-seek-to-learn-that-which-cannot-be-taught?tab=transcript,"If you'd told me a year ago that I'd be learning critical life and business lessons from the founder of a ketchup company and that 30 to 50,000 people would like to our conversation, I would have told you that was impossible. But the fact that it's true, proves many of the points laid out by this week's guest Scott Norton, co-founder of Sir Kensington's, which was recently acquired by Unilever. Sir Kensington's, which makes ""condiments with character"" is no ordinary ketchup company and Scott is no ordinary founder. We talk about the most elemental aspects of business, product, relationships, sales, marketing and culture.
I love that we can do so through the lens of such a seemingly simple product, something we use all the time with our families at a barbecue. Scott's observations on culture, the importance of relationships within sales and competitive edge are all memorable. But above all, I'll remember his line, seek to learn that which cannot be taught and I will continually return to the mental of the temple of Poseidon. Oh, and as a bonus, we also talk about biking around Asia, which like all of Scott's stories comes complete with thought provoking lessons. Enjoy this unique conversation with one of the most interesting people I've met on this journey.","Scott: [00:49:42] That's a good question. I think that the kindest thing that someone's done for us is, one of our now board members and a very, very early investor in Sir Kensington's really took a bet on us. His name is Keith Miller and I often refer to him as the godfather of our business. Here's someone that had no business meeting with two guys making ketchup. He works in a private equity firm in a fancy office in Midtown. He's an entrepreneur, CEO, board member of public companies. When you walk into his office, he's got pictures that he's taken on Polaroids of Kanye West and the Olsen twins. Here's someone who, before we had any social proof.Before we had any really evidence that we were going to be successful, he saw something in us and that was very personal to him and I think he took a shot on us and through thick and through thin. Whether we were beating budget or whether we were missing budget or whether things were looking up or things were looking challenging, he was just relentless in helping us get to that next level. Above and beyond what the responsibility that he would have as an individual was.Witnessing that kindness was inspirational and has been inspirational for me, because it goes along with this great piece of advice that my grandfather says which is, ""If you want to be successful, don't be a go getter, be a go giver."" It helped me recognize that not only do you get a personal benefit and an emotional satisfaction from being able to provide for others, but it's really necessary to help create the future and to be an innovative category as an innovative businesses where is no traction or proof. Or when there is, it's too late to be part of that early stage. Keith's been tremendously kind to both of us and he's been a role model for me.",Investment firm,,,Took a chance,,

Andy was also the co-founder and long-time partner at Benchmark Capital, one of the most interesting and successful venture capital firms in the world. We spend most of our conversation discussing venture capital investing and entrepreneurship. Andy coined the now ubiquitous term “product/market fit” and has great insight into how investors and entrepreneurs should think about business. In that vein, we discuss both what we refer to as the value hypothesis: building a product or service that customers love, and the growth hypothesis: scaling that product or service to a large market. We finish our conversation by talking about Andy and his team's mission at Wealthfront, and this conversation is perfectly timed, as Wealthfront just released a new feature that allows investors to buy factor portfolios, similar to Smart Beta ETFs.
Above all, I'll remember Andy's advice to put the gun in the other person's hand - a strategy we explore in the middle of our talk. We start our conversation discussing what has made Benchmark Capital so successful, which started with how the founders thought about their competition.

I actually think my entire career is a function of kindness and luck. God, when I was in business school... It's really funny that I worked on Wall Street for a couple of years after college. And I worked in mergers and acquisitions at Blyth, Eastman Dillon and the head of the M&A department was a Stanford grad. And he encouraged me to go to Stanford Business School because he knew I wanted to get into venture capital and he wrote a wonderful recommendation and I was lucky enough to get in. So, that was really good.And then turns out his son was a year ahead of me in business school. So he took me under his wing and his son introduced me to one of his best friends who, as it turns out, his father was then the CEO of Hewlett Packard, which was the Google of the day. And he had gone into venture capital. And for some reason, he took a liking to me and he introduced me around the venture capital firms. And that's how I got into the venture business. I started working while I was going to school. And just over and over and over again, people have done amazingly nice things for me to give me an opportunity.

Leigh Drogen,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/45467153/drogen-quant-vs-traditional-investors-and-how-alphas-become-betas?tab=transcript,"I've often joked that this show should be called, this is who you're up against. Because I am so often having conversations with brilliant people across the investment landscape who are effectively my competition and yours. This week's conversation fits that description because it gives you an inside view of how things work among some of Wall Street's most competitive investment firms. My guest is Leigh Drogen, who has worked as a statistical arbitrage portfolio manager and who founded and now runs Estimize. A data company that works with some of the world's largest hedge funds. Our conversation centers on the massive shift, from what we call discretionary portfolio management, basically stock-picking. To a landscape that is increasingly dominated by quantitative investors of various types. We talk about how any investor might hope to earn alpha and how doing so is harder and harder. There are so many great stories in this episode told by someone with the perfect career experience to know how the system actually works. After many episodes where I've been learning on the fly about topics like venture capital, permanent equity, or even health.
All right, Leigh. Well, I've been really excited about this one because I have intentionally avoided most discussions of quantitative investing on the podcast. Just because I spent most of my 10 years of my career doing this. And I thought it'd be fun to branch out a little bit, but I'm not ready to dip my toes back into the water. And we met very briefly at, I think it was a Quant Conference, actually. And we started talking about Favor, and we started chatting about something very specific, which we'll get to in a minute. But then I also came across a piece that you wrote on LinkedIn. Which I thought was one of the most thoughtful pieces on the current state of the investing spectrum between traditional, deep fundamental work and quantitative investors. And how that balance might look in the future. And that's really where I'd like to focus today. Because I think it is a fascinating shift that we're watching in real-time. And that a lot of big people, even famous people are being left behind by this move towards quant.","Leigh: [01:13:14] Oh, man. Well, it's very simple. My co-founder Brian Smith, I think it's the luckiest thing that ever happened to me was finding him. So a lot of people don't know this. Some people know it, but a lot of people don't know that the first year of this company was just terrible. We did everything we could possibly do wrong and the company almost died. In fact, there's an article in Business Insider from our launch day in January of '12, where I have shingles because I have not eaten or slept. And I'm just freaking out because we have to get this thing out the door. And I fired my original co-founder, who was a very nice guy, but we just did not work well together at all. And we just barely got the platform out the door and I was just a wreck emotionally, mentally, physically. And they had to airbrush my face because one side of my face is all puffy and everything. So the article's great. The image is ridiculous because one of my eyes is almost closed.So we get the platform out the door and our intern at the time was an incredible engineer, held the thing together for three months. And I find this guy who lives in San Diego, where I went to school, who I met on AngelList of all places, which we've hired a ton of people from since. And it's an incredible platform. And I meet Brian and on a whim, he flies out to New York for a week and stays with me in my apartment. And we go at this problem. Okay. So we have this platform out the door, but it's like, ""Is this going to work?"" It's very much just still the experiment. And he spends a week and he goes home and he emails me the next day. And he's just like, ""I'm in."" And we paid him basically nothing for the first like six months while we did this experiment. And this guy could go to work anywhere. He was a former Google cryptography expert. Incredible guy, just did this on a whim. The idea, me, whatever he bet on, he just bet on all of it. And without him, this thing never would've worked. And I wouldn't have gotten to do any of this. I would've gone back to running money or something. And I think it's the luckiest thing that happened in my life. And I wouldn't have taken that bet. It was a disaster. The operational aspect of this thing was a disaster up until then. And he comes in and nothing goes perfectly well.

In both his book and this conversation, there is a lot about family, loyalty, and hard work. Principles which really resonate with me. You'll emerge from this hour with an appreciation of hustle and what it takes to get ahead. I can't stop thinking about our discussion on how sources of power in any career morph through time. A framework that can help anyone think about their work and where to apply effort.

I have a long history with my guest, Dave Chilton, but this was the first time we'd met in person. I'd heard stories about him from people I worked with for 20 years. So getting to finally spend time with him was a real treat. I'll let him reveal the connection. This episode will also be fun for listeners in the US as Dave is one of the best-known people in Canada because of his famous book, The Wealthy Barber and his more recent stint as a dragon on Dragon's Den, which is Canada's version of Shark Tank. I called this episode, The Human Blitzkrieg because of Dave's relentlessly positive style and curiosity. He is dabbled in many parts of the business and investing worlds. He's one of the most successful authors in history has invested in dozens of interesting businesses and is a Jedi Master in the long lost art of the phone conversation.
We discuss business investing and writing. If you enjoy this conversation and have any aspirations as a writer, I highly recommend you check out the series of videos, Dave and his son recently released called The Chilton Method, which I will link in the show notes. I have no financial interest in this recommendation and actually, neither does Dave. He put it together in large part to stop people from calling him for advice.

Dave: [01:33:43] Wow, that's an interesting one. I've been treated exceptionally well in general. Everywhere I go, people will say, the book made a difference in whatever else. But I think early in my career, I reached out to a number of people and said, ""I don't know what I'm doing. I'm going to self publish. And can you spend some time with me?"" And not a single person said, no, not one. You know, Andrew Tobias, remember Andrew Tobias?

Patrick: [01:34:01] Yeah sure.

Dave: [01:34:02] I found him in New York. I sent him my book. I said, ""Do you mind reading it? You're my hero."" Didn't like it. Got back to me. That's fine. Didn't like the book, but gave me a couple of tips and just handle himself like a true gentleman. And I always think of that and what a difference it made to me and all that. John Templeton gave me the cover endorsement for the Wealthy Barber in the United States.

Patrick: [01:34:22] Wow. Cool.

Dave: [01:34:22] And listen to this story. I phoned him and he picked up his phone and this is actually a funny story. I was like 27 and he picks up his phone and he says, ""John Templeton speaking."" And honestly, I was like, Holy shit what are you going to say? I was ready to go through the whole process of begging to get him on the phone. I said like, ""John, John, John, John Temple speaking. Why is he answering his own phone?"" And then I gave him the pitch, what a great guy. So kind and nice. And he said, ""I really liked that idea of using the story, send the book down."" I got something back from him I bet a week later. Said, ""I read the book cover to cover, I really liked it. Agreed with all of it, thought it was fantastic.""

So I mean, people in general have been exceptionally nice to me. And I've really... I've never been sued. I've never sued anybody. I've never had any major conflicts. I've just kind of tried to keep it light and loose. And I'm not very money-oriented either, which I think is probably a good thing. I think people who are all around money tend to get in a lot of conflicts and have a lot of those issues. And I like learning.

Our conversation is in two parts. First, we dive deep into the lessons of his eight year research project, studying CEOs who are master capital allocators. These CEOs include Henry Singleton, John Malone, Tom Murphy, Katharine Graham, and Warren Buffett. We discuss how these CEOs tended to be contrarians on topics like dividends, buybacks, acquisitions, and the use of debt. As we go through each of the tools in the capital allocators toolkit, you'll hear several useful lessons for running or evaluating a business.
In the second part, we cover Will's career in private equity. Will founded and continues to run Housatonic Partners, investing in buyouts, recaps and search funds. Will has been one of the most active search fund investors for decades.

There was a clear division between capital and labor in the group, and they very generously as things went along and returns sort of came in pretty well, they proactively very generously shared economics with me in a way that they didn't have to, in a way that was just very sort of set a certain tone for the culture of our firm.

Danny Moses,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/16551200/moses-the-big-short-and-beyond?tab=transcript,"Many of the most fun investing conversations are with traders and portfolio managers, because they live and breathe risk, day in and day out. Of course, they are often risking other people's money, but controlling real money in markets is hard to match. Theories and ideals can fade quickly, well laid plans often don't last. This week's guest is someone who has lived through his fair share of market highs and lows and I think you'll be able to tell quickly why I so enjoy conversations like this one. My guest is Danny Moses who is directly in the middle of one of the biggest trades in market history, chronicled by Michael Lewis in his book, The Big Short. Danny was the head trader on the FrontPoint Team, led by Steve Eisman, who along with a small handful of others, like Michael Burry and John Paulson, made enormous profits during the financial crisis, as they figured out, in real time, the disaster that was brewing in mortgage-backed securities and figured out how to position their portfolios in a way that would benefit from their insight. No easy feat.My conversation with Danny is multi-faceted, we talk about Danny's role in The Big Short, both the trade itself and the making of Michael Lewis's book. We cover the history and current state of sell-side research and how ETFs and other trends have made it difficult for traditional bottom-up fundamental managers. We even talk about Dominique Strauss-Kahn.

We went from Bulldog football and Long Term Capital to the kindest thing. I've been given big breaks, and so anyone that says, wherever they are in life, that they weren't given an opportunity, I think it's what you do with the opportunity. I would say I was lucky to have the parents that I had, but secondly, there was a particular person, John Race , in my life. He runs a fund, DRZ, DePrince, Race & Zollo, down in Florida. He was the guy I looked up to, a good friend of my father's, a little bit younger than him, and he got me my job at Friedman, Billings, and Ramsey, at the time. Basically made a phone call for me and it was really out of kindness, because he knew I was a good sales guy and so forth, so that turned out to be the biggest break of my life. And he's always been that kind of guy for me, that's the guy I look up to, my mentor in this business, so I would say that was one of them

I'm trying to think what else. My wife does kind stuff for me all the time, I would have to mention that, or I'd be in deep trouble, but you got me on that one. Many people have been great to me. And again, I would go back to, people can open the doors for you, and it's what you do with it once you get it. And I'll be the first to say, my aunt got me my first job, but she didn't get me the promotion, she didn't get me ... So there's always been people that've opened doors for me, but I think people should never take that for granted and then always do the most with the opportunities that they get.

"Royce Yudkoff, Rick Ruback",https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/37952927/yudkoff-really-private-equity?tab=transcript,"In this episode, I continue to pull on one of the most interesting threads that I have uncovered in the course of producing this podcast, the world of permanent equity. My guests today are Royce Yudkoff and Rick Ruback. Two Harvard Business School professors, who have partnered to create a popular class that teaches students how to search for, acquire, and run a small business directly after graduation. The course is aimed at students who want hands-on management experience as soon as possible. After purchase, there's no timetable for selling the business. Indeed, if done well, there's never any reason to sell because the free cash flow yields to owners are higher than most alternatives. I approached this conversation from an investor standpoint. LP Investors usually partner with the searchers to form what is called a search fund. A search fund allows recent MBA grads to spend time looking for a business and ultimately acquire it. The result is small in scale but it's often a high return proposition for investors. I loved our discussion on what to look for in a business and what to avoid. The principles we list are useful for investors of any kind and will be particularly appealing to those from the buy and hold, value investing, or quality investing camps. One point of note which wasn't captured during the recording.
One of the reasons this style of investing isn't more well known is that it's extremely expensive upfront.

Royce and Rick, thank you very much for taking the time with me today to discuss a topic that is still relatively new to me, probably discovered it just three, four months ago. But I think from an investor standpoint and also from an operator standpoint is a really ripe and interesting niche in the world of investing, which is that of search funds. Maybe we could begin by you describing, pretending that I'm an LP looking for interesting things to do with my capital. Sort of explains at a high-level the idea behind a search fund and why both recent MBA grads but also LP investors might be interested in this concept.","Rick: [01:19:39] I think that's right. I guess I will say in a more personal light. I will say that I feel really lucky to teach at Harvard Business School. I've been here since 1987, so I guess that's 30 years. There's just been a number of times where the school has been wonderfully kind. I don't think about the Harvard Business School but I'll just reflect on one example that I think was amazing. I had a kid who was seriously sick and the family had gathered in my house and it was the year of the huge snowstorms. Remember that year of the huge snowstorms?

Patrick: [01:20:18] Maybe.

Rick: [01:20:19] Yeah, maybe. I live in Backbend and there was no place to put the snow. I get a call from somebody in the dean's office that says, ""Rick, I know you're going through a hard time. Is there anything we can do to be helpful? Just anything we can do to be helpful? Anything at all?"" I said, ""Yeah, I just can't park in my back. My parking lot is filled."" In like 32 seconds it seemed like, I'm back off to the hospital and my oldest son calls me and he's babysitting his kids. He says, ""You just won't believe what's happening in your backyard in the alley."" There's like 10 dump trucks and a bulldozer picking up the snow and moving it along so we can have a place to park."" That was one of a dozen nice things that Harvard Business School does, so I really appreciate that.",Employer,,,Help in time of need,,
Boyd Varty,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/65765159/varty-the-art-of-tracking?tab=transcript,"This week's episode is the most unique to date. My guest is Boyd Varty, who grew up in the South African wilderness, living amongst and tracking wild leopards. The main theme of our conversation is the art of tracking, and how the same strategy for pursuing animals in the wild can be applied to all aspects of our lives. Boyd's family has been part of the South African safari world for four generations and he is bringing what they have collectively learned to a larger audience around the world. The episode includes the best answer I've ever heard, which comes when I ask Boyd to describe his most memorable experience.
We also discuss the potential dangers of an achievement or goal-oriented mindset, and what he learned from spending time with Nelson Mandela as a boy. This episode is one I hope you share with those you love because I think Boyd's ideas will have a profound impact on many who are thinking about what to do with their lives, whether they are young or old.

I think one of the things that pops to mind and it's maybe not from a person, but I have felt that having a relationship with nature has been an act of incredible kindness from the natural world to me. I feel like anytime I've had problems, anytime I've been unsure, anytime I've lost my way, for me, retreating into nature has been an incredible sense of being cared for, of being in a field of kindness, in a field of presence, in a field of ... Maybe because it's a nonverbal environment, so you come out of the verbal mind and what you come to is ... What happens is a kind of oneness and so, that has been a big one.The other is, I feel like I've been lucky to be mentored, so meeting Martha as a safari guide and she met me, I was taking people out on safari. I was some guy out in South Africa and she just immediately, with no reason to, just started saying, ""Look, I love what you do and I'll help you."" She really grew me, she taught me how to be a coach. She taught me how to work with people and she just did it. It was just natural to her, so I feel like that was pretty amazing.

Khe Hy,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/66604799/hy-quant-hedge-funds-and-the-fear-of-death?tab=transcript,"My guest this week is Khe Hy. Khe has a very interesting two-part story. We start with Khe's career at BlackRock, where he rose to be one of the youngest MDs at the firm, specializing in quantitative hedge funds. Khe shares his perspective on how the hedge fund landscape has changed and what investors should look for in hedge fund managers in the future. The second part of the story is about Khe's attempt to understand himself. We get into fear, joy, and all that he has learned across several years of introspection and exploration. His lessons coalesce around four key pillars, compassion, stillness, what he calls uncomfortable introspection, and finding the truth. We explore what he means by each of these ideas in some detail.I'm not sure if Khe is capable of lying. He's one of the most honest people I've met for better or worse and was kind to share both his struggles and moments of clarity on investing and life. With deep questions about purpose and deep questions about how to evaluate a quant hedge fund, this was my kind of conversation. For show notes, visit investorfieldguide.com/khe. And now please enjoy my conversation with Khe Hy.
This is going to be a conversation that I think about a third or half of the way through, will really start to surprise people. But we're going to start in a comfortable world, which is that of finance and investing. If you could give a 30 second to a minute summary of your career from start to finish in finance, we'll use that as the jump-off point kind of where you are and what you did at a high level.","Khe: [01:42:17] I would say it's going to sound a little weird at first. But my friend, Sunil, as a connector, I'm always meet someone how can I be helpful? What can I give to you? But he told me once, and I think this is, I'd say kindness it's also probably the best advice that I think I've ever gotten. And he said, ""The best gift that you can give someone is to share authentically with them and to share vulnerably."" And it didn't really hit me for a while. Because he said this before I had done a lot of this journey and now it's very, very much resonates. And I think that because of that it just the compassion that it unlocks, but it's just, it is our natural state as humans to be vulnerable. We have something that scares us or that holds us back. And if you share that it creates this safe space for someone to share back. And from that, you get true relationships, true like real. Versus, ""Oh, how'd your day gone? How did your day go?"" And so I think that that was kindest, it is definitely a form of kindness. But it's also, I think the greatest piece of advice that I think I've ever gotten.It is our natural state as humans to be vulnerable. We have something that scares us or that holds us back. And if you share that it creates this safe space for someone to share back. And from that, you get true relationships.",Peer,,,Mentorship,,

I owe a huge thank you to everyone listening, especially to those who have shared the ones they've enjoyed most with their friends. I haven't done a single thing to ""market"" this show. It has been a hundred percent organic word of mouth growth. So the large audience size is thanks to you all. I deeply appreciate it. But I appreciate even more, however, is that the show's success has pushed me to be more thoughtful about what admittedly remains an informal process of searching for the most interesting people I can find that will share lessons they've learned with me and with you. Were it not for the podcast, I would never have met most of the people you hear each week. Some of those guests have become dear friends, including the two in this week's episode, Ted Seides, and Brent Beshore. Ted and I flew out to St. Louis to spend a day with Brent. While we are all passionate about investing, we've had very different careers. Ted in alternatives, hedge funds, and fund to funds, Brent in lower middle-market private equity, and my own in quantitative equities. What we share is a passion for investing in general and a deep interest in where the asset management business and profession is going. This conversation starts like most episodes, somewhat structured exploration of the investing business, but moves to be a bit more fun and informal as we work our way through a bottle or two of wine. In the latter half, we talk about how to dissect an industry, common features of good businesses within a given industry, books we'd like to write, books we wish existed, and things we've learned in our careers. We spent a long time talking about Ted's famous bet with Warren Buffet, but I've removed most of that and saved the conversation for another time. You'll hear us reference it here and there, mostly giving Ted help, but rest assured we will the entire thing in more detail at a later date. I could spend all my free time having conversations like this one and die happy. Thank you again for listening and sharing because you're doing so has allowed me to find people like Brent, Ted, and many others, and lead to friendships that have quickly become an important part of my life.

Jim O'Shaughnessy,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/35503206/oshaughnessy-premeditated-success?tab=transcript,"My guest this week is my father, Jim O'Shaughnessy. I debated whether or not to do this interview, but many people have asked for it. I'm glad that I did. I had never heard a few of the stories he tells, which is a testament to the power of this kind of interview.My dad was a pioneer of quantitative equity research, part of an early group of explorers that studied factors which predicted future stock returns. While many of his peers were academics, he was a pure practitioner from day one. Along with others at our firm, we've been through a lot together professionally and everyone would agree that the guy has ice water in his veins and unwavering discipline, two traits that can bring you far as an investor.For those looking for a discussion of factor investing, look elsewhere. Because we agree on just about everything in the world of investing, we chose to instead discuss what has been a fascinating career, chock full of business and life lessons.What's most interesting about our relationship is that he's taught me very few things in particular. Instead, he's opened the doors which have allowed me to learn and experience so much more on my own than I ever could have hoped to learn under his direct tutelage. It's the model for fatherhood that I am using with my kids, and I couldn't be more thankful for the example he has set.We talk about premeditation, business, learning, books, and his wild experience during the tech boom.

Definitely a close second kindest thing that anyone has ever done for me. I think the kindest thing that was ever done for me was done by a mentor of mine. When we moved here to Greenwich, we were new to the area, your mother is a real nester. I had a certain amount of capital that I was going to put towards the business and getting OCM off the ground.But another maxim, happy wife, happy life. So she needed a house. I built that house, consuming that capital, it was supposed to go to the business. And then found very inconveniently that I wasn't going to be given a mortgage, because of my brilliance. I needed to have a job that had paychecks and things like that.So this man with who I had been in several business ventures with, I was telling him my plight, and he goes, ""I'll loan you the money."" I went, ""Really, Jim? Really?"" He goes, ""Yeah,"" he goes, ""I've no doubt that you will do great things because I know what you're like."" And again, it's was that out of the blue, I took him up on his offer.And of course, naturally, when the bank who I was trying to get the mortgage from found out that I didn't need it anymore, then they wanted to give it to me, which I just think is so hysterical and so true. But he did that just because he believed in me. And obviously, it helped me out enormously and let me go on to create what I did.",Peer,,,Gift,it was a gift but in a time of need,

I just remember, like it was such a small thing, but I know that selling his business was so hard for him, and he was very emotional about it.

Peter Attia,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/41717296/attia-how-to-live-a-longer-higher-quality-life?tab=transcript,"In 2010, I got fat. Because I am a research junkie at heart, I started investigating ways to lose weight. If you, like me, like to do deep research, you know the thrill of finding ideas and people who have arrived at unique or contrarian solutions to common problems. This episode is not about weight loss, but I mentioned it because it was by finding and devouring the work of this week's guest, Peter Attia, M.D., that I reframed the way I think about health, period. Now, usually, I would describe someone's career chronologically, instead, what I'll say about Peter is that he's obsessed with mastery, a topic which we will discuss in detail. He has applied his pursuit of mastery to the fields of medicine, surgery, performance athletics, mathematics, mechanical engineering, racing, swimming, and many other areas.Peter's mission and the topic of our conversation is to understand and improve our lifespan, and what he calls our healthspan. Healthspan, which is a proxy for quality of life, is where we spend a lot of our time during our conversation, specifically in the areas of mind, body, spirit, and performance. We discuss what we can learn from studying centenarians, the problem of progress in science, a drug called rapamycin, which Peter thinks may be revolutionary, eating, the importance of muscle mass, the idea of distress tolerance, and the many similarities between health and investing. I went into this conversation hoping to emerge with a framework for thinking about health and wellbeing that I could share with you. Peter delivers in spades. I'm going to relisten to this one several times to pull out ideas which I can put into practice. I hope you get as much out of this talk as I did. Please enjoy this awesome conversation with Peter Attia.Oh, and one more thing, be sure to check out the show notes for this episode, which you can find at investorfieldguide.com/attia, A-T-T-I-A. I've included several links to great thought-provoking videos and articles on the topics we cover. Okay, off we go.","Peter: [01:22:59] I'm not thinking this hard because there haven't been many kind things done to me. It's, you want to think like, ""Am I missing the kindest?"" Because I have not received a kidney yet, but I'm not in the market. I don't know that this is the kindest, but it's certainly something that moved me because of how thoughtful and how subtle it was. So, in August of 2003, I met a woman who had come to the National Cancer Institute for an experimental surgical procedure. She had a rare type of melanoma called ocular melanoma. It's a melanoma that originates in the back of the eye, and almost without exception, these things spread to the liver, and they're fatal, they're uniformly fatal. You'll die very quickly. But we had this procedure where we would do this crazy operation where we'd basically take the liver out, hook it up to a whole bunch of canalis, perfuse it for like 6 hours with a chemotherapeutic agent that we could isolate from the rest of the body because it was so toxic, and then put the liver back in.

And we were basically asking the question like, ""Does this extend your life beyond a couple of months?"" Because that's what the life expectancy would have been. And it's a huge operation. The operation itself has probably a 5% chance of killing you. And so, she survived the operation, and I'm taking care of her in the hospital over the next couple of weeks because it's a big recovery. But I got to know her and really, like any of my patients, and I just really liked her. And I don't know how it came up because I don't even remember, but I told her how much I missed San Francisco. Obviously living in D.C., which was a nice place to live, but I still pined for the Bay Area. And I think I must've told her one day how much I loved the Golden Gate Bridge because I think as an engineer, it's just hard to not appreciate suspension bridges in general, but anybody who's stepped foot on the Golden Gate Bridge realizes it's gorgeous. And I used to go there once a week in medical school, or at least twice a month, but preferably once a week. So, she lived for another year. And her family was incredibly kind and grateful and thankful, and I stayed in touch with them actually. But about a year after she died, her husband sent me this big model of a Golden Gate Bridge that was in sort of an artistic rendition of this brass model that she had, and said to him, she wanted him to send to me, which I thought it was very kind.",Stranger,,,Gift,odd that Patrick tells him not to say parents or friends,

He sits on the board of McDonald's and he has given back to his community more than I can possibly list here.
John and I discuss Ariel's Investment process and its evolution over the years, lessons from John's basketball career, value investing and asset management's diversity problem among many other interesting issues.

I think I mentioned before how he wrote an article covering the intelligent fanatics of India. It's something that I was thinking about this book, maybe for a year before that, but it was really after reading that, that gave me a push to go after it. After I read his article, I emailed him, and I just said, ""Sanjay, this is a great article, is there any resources that you could point me to that would help me expand my mindset around this concept of intelligent fanatics? Is there anything?"" I thought he would just email me back right away and say, ""Yeah, here's the book 'The Outsiders',"" or something like that.

He didn't respond right away. About 2 weeks later, I get an email back from him, and he said, ""Here you go, Ian, I hope you enjoy."" In there was a PDF, and the PDF was 60 pages long, and in the PDF he listed about 18 different references of books, articles, case studies, research reports. And then below that he took out the parts of those books, case studies that applied to intelligent fanatics, and he highlighted them. Below that, his commentary on each thing, and I was just blown away. Obviously, the quality of what he just gave me was the holy grail, but the fact that anybody would take the time and effort to do that for somebody that I never met personally before I even talked to him on the phone. I maybe had five email correspondence with him. It have to have taken him hours to assimilate that much information into one PDF for somebody he barely knew across the world.

We have conversations like the one you are about to hear about once a month, and in all those conversations, just like this one, you can hear me just trying to keep up. Jeremiah is one of those perfect SAT score guys, literally, who talks about topics like artificial intelligence like he's placing a lunch order. His career has been in risk management and he is currently the head of risk management at a private family office in the New York area.
The conversation is in two halves. In the first, we discuss models, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. In the second, we talk about what risk means in a portfolio and how it can be managed or at least redistributed. You'll have to listen pretty closely to this one, but if these topics interest you, it's a chance to see one of the leading minds in the fields of data science, machine learning, and risk management at work. Please enjoy our conversation.","Jeremiah: [01:20:39] I'll stick to my career so I don't embarrass anybody. I have benefited enormously from people's kindness throughout my career. I've had a strange career in the sense that I've never had a job that I could interview for. Well, I've interviewed for jobs, but the requirements of my job have always evolved in ways that I could never have anticipated and, had I tried to interview for the job I later held, I'd probably be laughed out of the room simply because it's somewhat R&D driven, it's somewhat fanciful, it's just evolved in strange ways. And part of how my career has gotten to this point is because people have put trust in me, but also encouraged me in surprising ways. I have left jobs on great terms, on wonderful terms, and maintained relationships. I have come to jobs simply because we mutually agreed that there was something interesting to do and those are small forms of kindness.

I could point to momentous examples of kindness in my career. I'm going to choose to keep them private and instead, I'll just characterize the whole thing as being very fortunate to work with people who cared about development, both personal and professional, in equal measure with the sort of basic profit-maximizing objective that we all take on in a daily basis.",,,,,,
"Lauren Loktev, Kanyi Maqubela, Craig Shapiro",https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/23221928/shapiro-watching-a-venture-fund-at-work?tab=transcript,"This week's episode is with the partners of the Collaborative Fund, a venture capital firm based in New York City. I know from experience that the quality of a team is crucial to success in investing, whether that be in public markets, private equity, or venture capital, but I hadn't had a group interview of this sort before. So I figured I would create one and I'm glad I did. Lauren, Kanyi, even Craig touch on all aspects of their search and investing process. We discuss how they identify thematic change in the world and then build a portfolio around those themes.
I found the section on the various dimensions of a brand and how to build the brand to be particularly insightful. Above all, I think it's a great example of a team with chemistry on a singular mission. They all offer great advice on how to operate a business, build a team, and if you're a venture capitalist or angel investor, find interesting new investments. In the episode with Craig, I started with a question that was based on the piece that he wrote about roots and I've stolen that and used it as a way to understand people's backstory. And I thought it'd be fun to do it with Kanyi and Lauren as well. So maybe we could start with you Lauren, some formative aspects of your background, where you come from and what your experience is and how that informs your worldview, and how that got you here as a venture capitalist.","Lauren: [00:54:43] I'll go with my parents. They had some tough choices to make when I was a kid, we lived in the middle of Western Kentucky and I was not challenged in school and they ended up changing basically significant things in the education system of the district and the state. My mom joined the Kentucky Association for Educational Reform. They did a bunch of things to allow me to accelerate within that school system. And then their work paved the way for a bunch of other kids to do the same. And I think it ended up being certainly challenging at the time and they faced pushback, not only from the district, but here and there for me too. And I think that that is a really knowing what was best against everyone speaking otherwise took a lot of resilience and fortitude on their part. But also has been pretty neat to see other kids, I think one of the most powerful moments for me was when there was a kid that I babysat when she was about eight and I ended up chatting with her when she was then 13 and in medical school at the University of Kentucky.",Parents,,Family,Upbringing,"deciding between upbrining and sacrifice, really cool story of education",

If that job title sounds wide-ranging, it's because it is. Dan has his hands in most of the ways that Betterment interacts with its clients and how it invests their money. This is one very interested and smart guy who is clearly passionate about helping investors make better decisions. We talk about science fiction, automation, investor behavior, and how Betterment tries to solve problems beyond the automated asset allocation engine that is their bread and butter.

I try to start somewhere interesting every week so it's not just about business. Well, start with sci-fi.","Dan: [01:00:15] There are two that are definitely true. The first one, which is a little bit obvious but it's worth saying, is my wife. My wife's British. We met in London, and she not only said it was okay for us... She was a diplomat. She was able to move around the world a little bit easier than a lot of people were, but she said, ""Yeah, let's move to New York. Let's do that for a few years. This is about your career. I'm comfortable doing that for a little while."" Then, when I asked after a year... We moved to New York. A year later, I'm like, ""Hey, could I take a giant pay cut and go do this startup thing with some kids?"" Once again, we thought through it. We really worked on it. My wife and I have the best arguments in the world. They're genuinely really good. It's one of the best things I love about our relationship, is that we don't agree on everything, but when we disagree, I come out of it feeling like we made a better decision because we disagreed on it. So definitely her for giving me some leeway to try and do that. To be clear, I'm absolutely going to pay her back for that at some point in time when it's like, ""Now it's your turn. Where do you want to go? What do you want to do? I'm the trailing spouse. Let's go do your dreams."" Then the other one that actually, I don't think it would've been thought about as a kindness at the time, but it's really important to me. When I was in sixth or seventh grade, for some reason, there was a long period where I didn't have any good way of getting home after school. And there was this math teacher of mine who would give me rides home from school, and I really appreciated it. He was a good guy, and he would make sure, on rainy days, that I was able to get home rather than walk. One day, I hadn't done my homework, and I realized it at the beginning of the class. I did it through the course of the class, and I handed it in at the end of the class, saying, ""Oh, I forgot it. It was in my backpack,"" or something. And he got really upset with me. He said, ""I saw you do your homework through this."" And he said, ""I'm just really disappointed. I've done good things for you, and you've disappointed me by lying to me now."" That was one of those moments where it just hits you. It's not even shaming. It's just like, ""I need to be a better person."" And that moment, in terms of doing what's right, being honest about it, that's stuck with me for a long time. I don't think he was trying to be kind at the time, but that line in the sand, it's been very good for me.",Wife,,Family,Sacrifice,"putting his career before hers, being willing to move around for him",

Now, please enjoy my conversation with Farnam Street's Shane Parrish.","Shane: [00:43:46] Yeah, I think in general, the kindest thing people do is give me their time. That applies to personal relationships, whether it's friendships or dating or whatever. And it applies to life. Time is the one thing we really can't create more of. You can easily make more money, but you can't make more time. It's really important to be aware of and conscious of how you're spending that time. I think when people give me their time, that's the most valuable thing that they can give me, that's the kindest thing. If I treat that time with respect, and I value it, I think that's a good way to get more kindness of out people.But I wouldn't say there's been one individual act of kindness that stands above all. I'm also, again, it's hard for me to be representative. But I'm surrounded by incredibly kind people and incredibly generous people. It would just be a competition of sorts, that don't really matter to me. It's peoples' time and thoughtfulness that makes a big difference.",,,,Made time,,

I've always been envious of people in seats like yours, where you have this interesting top-down and bottom-up view of the asset management business, mutual funds, ETFs.

Let's start from the beginning. I was born in 1972. I was adopted, and the girl who gave me up for adoption got pregnant right before her freshman year of college. I was born in May of 1972, and they went through the ridicule of being pregnant without having an abortion, and I get to live my life. They had the courage and smarts to give me up. And I was lucky enough to then be adopted by my parents, who are my parents. And I have this family and I got to live this life.

In this episode, I ask the most important question first, so please enjoy.","Josh: [00:49:40] Honestly, I think a lot of people have done me a kindness in accepting me when I first started writing because the stuff I was writing was terrible because I really didn't know that much. I knew a couple of things really, really well viscerally from my experience in the business. A lot of what I was talking about in the early days was brokerage stuff. I knew it better than almost anyone because I had been a reluctant student of what was going on there. But then I started to branch out a little bit and talk a lot more about markets and investing and I had experience there. I was trading professionally for accounts and investing for myself, but there's no way I was even close to as knowledgeable as I am now.I mean, none of us are from eight years to now. I think people were really forgiving of whatever I didn't seem to know. They were willing to stick with me as I got better. I got better as a writer and got smarter as an investor. I think that that's been a really important kindness that I guess the public paid to me. Because it would have been easier to just say this kid's an idiot and maybe a lot of people did and I didn't hear about it. But just, I think people that have been reading me consistently and I hear from them all the time and they'll say, listen, you got a little bit shaky for a while.In 2011, some of the things you were talking about, the European macro situation, I was a little worried about you, Josh. But you pulled through. I think there are people that knew that they knew more than me, but they appreciated the writing and they gave me time to get better and smarter and to build my career. Frankly, I wasn't managing much money then I wasn't really going anywhere career wise and people were just like, I don't care. I want to hear what this guy has to say. Now obviously things have gotten better for me professionally, personally, and those people are still around and they paid me that kindness. They gave me a chance and I hope that I'm playing that role with other people who are now in the shoes that I was in.Try to link to a lot of the new up and coming financial bloggers, analysts, researchers. Guys send me stuff all the time I try to read it. It's not easy. I have two kids. I have a full-time job, but I think I'm trying to encourage people that are trying to figure out investing for themselves. I hope I'm helping. I'm not licking the garbage just because let me do this guy a favor. If somebody does something really smart and I could give you a few examples of new up and coming blogs, I'll link to it. I'll send a few thousand people to that site. If they keep going, they'll build their own audience, they don't need any help from me.

Craig Shapiro,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/83914456/shapiro-better-for-you-better-for-the-world?tab=transcript,"This week, we dive into the world of venture capital. My guest is Craig Shapiro, founder, and CEO of the New York-based Collaborative Fund, which was an early investor in companies like Lyft, Kickstarter, and Reddit. Craig's mission at the Collaborative Fund is to find and invest in companies that are both better for you and better for the world, a unique combination which leads to very interesting investments. One of the great things about getting older is the ability to judge people's character faster and more accurately. Within five minutes, Craig made a very strong impression on me as a person. You can tell that he is both humble and kind, but also driven and decisive. This is a special person and a special guest on the show. Like the Ted Seides episode on hedge funds, this conversation on venture capital is a great high-level introduction to alternative investing.
I read a post by yours, which has really inspired me, which is the one about roots and the importance of personal roots in the outcomes in your life and your professional career. I would love to start by hearing a little bit about your personal roots, and how they sprouted into what has become the Collaborative Fund.","Craig: [00:51:41] Yeah, I think outside of the just very tangible way of trusting me with their capital, I think supporting us through challenging times, right? So one of our investors told me early on, actually prior to him investing, said, ""Craig, I'm going to make an investment in you with one condition."" And I said, ""Okay, what's that?"" He said, ""Don't shine the turd."" And I said, ""What does that even mean?"" And he said, ""If something..."" Can I use bad language? Craig: [00:52:19] ""If something shitty happens, I'm a grown-up. I've been there, done it. I've been successful in business. I know how these things go. Tell me, because if it's shitty, it's eventually going to smell. And you can only polish that for so long, so hiding it, treating us with white gloves, or treating me with white gloves, is not going to work. I want you to make a pledge that when something doesn't go right, I want to be the first to know about it.""

And I think that was incredibly... That was maybe the best gift, because it gave me then permission, frankly, to be totally transparent about not just the ups, which is what you want to share with your investors, right? You want to tell them, ""Gosh, this company's doing fantastically well, and we're on track to create really positive returns."" But in reality, there are ups and downs. And so having the permission to share the downs and the insecurities that come along with it, I think, is probably the most generous thing that any of our group has done.",Investment firm,,,Mentorship,"Gave advice to not polish a turd, also could be took a chance but it was actually the good advice that was the winner here",

Please enjoy this conversation with Brent Beshore.","Brent: [01:31:32] Wow. Kindest thing. So it's easy to look back and tell a tight, nice story of how everything came together. And I hope anybody with experience probably realizes that that's not the case, right? Life is far messier than quick soundbites explain. And my entrepreneurial journey initially over the first couple of years was rough. I got myself into a challenging spot. I mean, making money is hard. Creating a stable company from scratch is just, it's like eating glass. I think that's a great analogy, every day. And I'd gotten myself into a spot where there were a lot of big egos involved in the business. And some challenging things that happened. And I had some people who acted very unethically and unprofessionally. And man, I was just kind of at the end of my rope. And there's a guy who worked for me, his name's Craig Brace. And he's the guy I was mentioning before that looked a little older and came into the acquisition with me. And it was probably, six months or so before that, that I really hit the bottom of the trough. And I can remember crying on my way to work. I mean, the sound, you talk about raw, I mean, this is just the reality of it. I think a lot of people go through this. But I thought I was a complete failure. I thought I was doomed. I sort of had dreams about having to get a fast-food job or something. Right. And I had a guy named Craig who was older, much wiser, just one of the kindest human beings I've ever met, who I opened up to him. And he was one of my employees. Right. And I kind of had this moment where I was like, I should be working for him and not in reverse. And he sat there, listened to me, was patient with me. And for about a month or six weeks, I mean he kind of nursed me back to health. I don't know how else to describe it. Mentally and emotionally. He was a rock. I mean, just unfailing rock. And if it wasn't for him, I mean, I probably haven't told him this enough, I think things could've turned out very differently.So I think sometimes we all just need a person to be real with. And I hate the culture around business and that everyone's killing it. Right. And that's why even I hate talking about the returns and all of that. Because it sounds like such bravado BS and I don't want it to come across like that. Making money is brutal, right? Trying to be successful in business and just operate any business regardless of the business you're in. I'm sure the investing business is exactly the same. It's just so hard. And I think you need to have real relationships with people and I'm not saying trust to that degree, a lot of people. But I think you need to find some people that you really can cry in front of and be your worst in front of. And be your most insecure in front of. And hope they love you regardless. And yeah, he definitely was that for me. So I don't know if that's probably a really weird answer.",Employees,,,Support,,

I was reading Phil Knight's new book, Shoe Dog, which I really enjoyed and saw in connection with the interview that you, Gerry had, I think the third fastest time at... certainly at Villanova, but some four-minute mile. I'd love to hear, just tell me a little bit about the first time you did it.","Jim: [00:51:48] Wow. Boy. That's the enormity of that... I honestly, I'm not even sure how I could handle that. Yeah. If I said I'm not where I am today without the help from a lot of different people, I'm not sure I can honestly even pick one. That's-

Patrick: [00:52:06] Fair enough.

Gerry: [00:52:07] Yeah. I think the same. Patrick, I just think of the, we will sometimes have interns that'll come through and ask for some career guidance. I remember one time I was asked a question like, ""What do I need to do to be in your seat in 10 years?"" I thought about it and it's like, there are so many people that did great things for me along the way that it's impossible for me to say, if you follow this roadmap, you're going to end up in the seat in 10 years time. Whether it's coaches that instilled in me certain work ethics, whether it's Gus probably taking a little bit of a leap in terms of a belief that I could do the job initially, people along the way, just great mentors, great people to work with. Mike Bucoy, I work with on the desk, there is probably nobody knows more knowledgeable about market structure and trading and I sit three feet away from him. I don't need to call up anybody, I just say, ""Mike, look at this situation, what do you think?"" Phenomenal person, a mentor that you have working with you. I think Jim and I are both beneficiaries of a lot of people within Vanguard who've been like that. One of the competencies that are really valued here, I think at Vanguard is, how are you when it comes to developing other people? It's something that people really take seriously. I know we have younger traders on the desk and that's something that every one of the more senior traders is always trying to make sure that these people know everything that you can possibly pass on to them to help them grow their career. It's something that, it definitely is something that's taken seriously and we've both been great beneficiaries of it.",,,,,,

We discussed among other things interesting trends in OKCupid's data, artificial intelligence, the NSA, and great books on the Civil War.",Question not found,,,,,,
Morgan Housel,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/19365640/housel-walking-and-thinking?tab=transcript,"My guest today is Morgan Housel, who just about all my listeners will already know. Morgan just left a long time post at The Motley Fool to join The Collaborative Fund, a venture capital firm here in New York City. Morgan is a good friend who will hopefully be a recurring guest on the show. In this episode, we discussed the differences between private and public markets investing, how to foster innovation and creativity, how businesses are structured and organized and how Morgan finds interesting books and information.","The first I ever got into investing was reading Jason Zweig when I was a late teenager, or maybe I was 20 years old. It just clicked with me not only because it made sense, but I'm just thinking, this guy's such a good writer. It was a couple years ago. What was it? I met Jason Zweig randomly at an event one time and just shook his hand and I was star struck and it was two seconds, ""Nice to meet you, bye."" I emailed him and said, ""Hey, I'd love to grab lunch with you sometime."" He accepted and we ended up having a conversation for hours. I was legitimately star struck around Jason. He was just larger than life in the field of investing and writing, which is what I wanted my career to be at the time. He was so supportive with his time and supportive. So, he's someone that I look back at as that helped me so much. I think most people who are as busy as he was, if they get an email from a stranger that says, ""Hey, I want to have a three-hour lunch with you,"" he would say, ""No, I don't have time for that."" So, that stood out to me as pretty big.",Mentor,,,Made time,gave time to have lunch and chat,
Jason Zweig,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/58814107/zweig-the-power-of-serendipity?tab=transcript,"My guest today is Jason Zweig, author of many great books including the recent Devil's Financial Dictionary which everyone should own. The way that Jason speaks and seemingly premeditated and perfect paragraphs makes me wonder if his writing even gets edited. Jason's insights and advice are the result of a life of critical thinking, reading, writing, humility, and curiosity. We cover a lot but be sure to stay untill the end. This conversation crescendos into an amazing finish that is more about life than just investing.","Jason: [00:57:28] Wow, that's such an amazing question because there are so many things I can't even... I mean, the list is a mile long. The longer I work in my field, the more I become convinced that personal relationships are just immensely important. The first kind of junior grunt job I ever had in journalism, I was hired for and 25 years later or something like that, I found the person who had hired me who had been retired. And I insisted, ""I have to take you out to lunch."" And I said to him, ""Why on earth did you hire me?"" I mean, I had no experience, I looked like a slob. And there was no reason for you to do that. I mean, I had no credentials, no experience, no track record, no nothing. And he said, ""You just seemed like the kind of person I should take a chance on."" And that's certainly one example of somebody who was kind to me, but maybe there's a story about luck I should tell. So because it was kindness, but I think it was kindness almost by nature rather than by action.So in 2002, I attended a conference and there were hundreds of people there, including a lot of journalists. And I saw a former colleague of mine, somebody I was, and still am very fond of Nina Munk with whom I had worked at Forbes and who then went to Fortune and I hadn't seen her in a while. And I was talking with a bunch of my best friends and I saw her across the room and I said, ""I'll be right back. I want to say hi to Nina."" And I plowed through the crowd the way you have to do and it was worked because there were a lot of people there. And eventually, I found her and we had a really nice chat and we both said, ""Oh, I'm so glad we both took the time to say hi."" And a few months later, my phone rang and it was a young editor at HarperCollins who said, ""We have this book, it's really old but it still kind of sells and we need somebody to polish it up. And would you be interested?"" And I said, ""Well, what is it?"" And he said, ""The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham."" And I said, ""Yes."" And he said, ""Well, do you want to think about it?"" And I said, ""No.""And then I called my wife and said, ""Is this okay?"" So after I finished the project which took four months of working seven days a week, by the way, exclusively, I took him and his boss out to lunch. And I said, ""Why did you guys ask me?"" And his boss said, ""Oh, well, we published this book by Nina Munk and I was asking her, we have this other thing, who do you think could do that?"" She said, ""Oh, there's only one person who should do that. You should ask Jason Zweig."" And it immediately occurred to me that if I hadn't kind of plowed my way across that room a few months earlier to find her, I wouldn't have been at the top of her mind. She might have mentioned me or she might've said, ""I'm not sure, I'd have to think about that."" And it was definitely kind of her to think of me, but it was also lucky that we had both taken the time to talk to each other. So, serendipity and luck are so important in life, and even people who are-",Boss,,,Took a chance,"first person to hire him, took him to lunch years later",
Michael Mauboussin,https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/43646785/mauboussin-active-asset-management?tab=transcript,"My guest today is Michael Mauboussin, whose research on all aspects of investing is a treasure trove. Michael is a Managing Director and Head of Global Financial Strategies at Credit Suisse. In this wide-ranging interview, we discuss the current state of the asset management business, explore all stages of the investment process, and consider what edges may still exist for those trying to beat the market. Please enjoy. Thank you Michael so much for being here with me today. I have to start by saying when I started in this business as an active manager, my first role was to learn about investing and I was a philosophy major, so I didn't know much at all. And so I went to the bookstore and bought a bunch of books. And the first two that I read, one was by David Dreman called Contrarian Investment Strategies, which I still love to this day. And the second book was a book that you wrote with your mentor called Expectations Investing. And so we're going to get into that book today for sure, but I thought an interesting connection, so it's a pleasure now to be here talking about the industry with you.",Question not found,,,,,,

Jeff is also one of the nicest people I've come across in this business. It's been a pleasure getting to know him in recent months. In our conversation, we discussed the history and current state of shareholder activism and how Jeff invests himself taking large positions and often board sits in undervalued companies. Please, enjoy.","Jeff: [01:16:58] Definitely, Arthur Levitt got me into Columbia Business School. I applied there. I did the interview. After I got in, I think it was the first week of school, I think it was the dean of admissions called me into her office and basically explained we wouldn't have let you in for Arthur which in hindsight, I think her telling me was... I'm glad that she told me. I'm glad I knew. It did motivate me as opposed to make me resent them. I'm incredibly grateful that they did it because going to that school has been extraordinarily good to me, but then at the same time, there's a part of me that's like, ""They should be taking more people like me.""
